# Vaults are not ERC4626 compliant

## Summary

## Vulnerability Detail
The vaults are not fully ERC4626 compliant
- The function [_claimDeposit](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-03-amphor/blob/main/asynchronous-vault/src/AsyncSynthVault.sol#L742) should emit a `Deposit` event. (MUST be emitted when tokens are deposited into the Vault via the mint and deposit methods.)
- The function [_claimRedeem](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-03-amphor/blob/main/asynchronous-vault/src/AsyncSynthVault.sol#L758) should emit a `Withdraw` event. (MUST be emitted when shares are withdrawn from the Vault in EIP-4626.redeem or EIP-4626.withdraw methods)
