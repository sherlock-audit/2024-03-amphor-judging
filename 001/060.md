# Receiver will be unable to claim redeem when address of `owner` and `receiver` are different in `requestredeem`

## Summary
In the `requestredeem` function two addresses are passed as parameters `owner` and `reciever` If the owner is different from receiver it means two different values will be passed in those parameters. The `requestredeem` calls the `_createRedeemRequest` function which maps the address of the owner to the current epochId here `lastRedeemRequestId[owner] = epochId` also the epochId is also mapped to the `redeemRequestBalance` here `epochs[epochId].redeemRequestBalance[receiver] += shares;`. However in the `claimRedeem` which is called by the receiver(as stated by the protocol team) calls the `_claimRedeem` which tries to fetch the redeemRequestBalance to be claimed which was set earlier. It does so by checking the mapping `lastRedeemRequestId` to the address of the reciever to get the `epochId` which in this case is a different from the address used to set epochID earlier. Thus will return 0 since address of reciever was never mapped to epochId. Invariably the redeemRequestBalance will also be zero since there is no valid epochId to fectch its value.

`claimRedeem` FUNCTION HERE IS TO BE CALLED MY RECIEVER ADDRESS WHICH
 CAN BE DIFFERENT FROM OWNER AS STATED BY PROTOCOL TEAM. 
RECIEVER CAN CHOOSE TO RECIEVE INTO ANY ADDRESS OF THEIR CHOICE.
 function claimRedeem(address receiver)
        public
        whenNotPaused
        returns (uint256 assets)
    {
        return _claimRedeem(_msgSender(), receiver);
    }




 function _claimRedeem(
        address owner,
        address receiver
    )
        internal
        whenNotPaused
        returns (uint256 assets)
    {
        assets = previewClaimRedeem(owner);
        uint256 lastRequestId = lastRedeemRequestId[owner];
        uint256 shares = epochs[lastRequestId].redeemRequestBalance[owner];
        epochs[lastRequestId].redeemRequestBalance[owner] = 0;
        _asset.safeTransferFrom(address(claimableSilo), address(this), assets);
        _asset.transfer(receiver, assets);
        emit ClaimRedeem(lastRequestId, owner, receiver, assets, shares);
    }
```
`address owner` here was passed the value msg.sender so though we have the parameter named `owner` the value passed is `msg.sender` who happen to be the receiver thus a different value from the actual owner set in ``requestredeem` function.

## Vulnerability Detail
Lets do a detailed walkk through from Requestredeem to claimredeem to highlight the bug.

A user wants to place a request redeem to be claimed by another address `reciever`. He calls the function `Requestredeem`
```solidity
function requestRedeem(
        uint256 shares,
        address receiver,
        address owner,
        bytes memory data
    )
        public
        whenNotPaused
        whenClosed
    {
        if (_msgSender() != owner) {
            _spendAllowance(owner, _msgSender(), shares);
        }
        if (previewClaimRedeem(receiver) > 0) {
            revert MustClaimFirst(receiver);
        }
        if (shares > maxRedeemRequest(owner)) {
            revert ExceededMaxRedeemRequest(
                receiver, shares, maxRedeemRequest(owner)
            );
        }

        _update(owner, address(pendingSilo), shares);
        // Create a new request
        _createRedeemRequest(shares, receiver, owner, data);
    }
```
A series of logics is implemented then the function ` _createRedeemRequest` was called
```solidity
    function _createRedeemRequest(
        uint256 shares,
        address receiver,
        address owner,
        bytes memory data
    )
        internal
    {
        epochs[epochId].redeemRequestBalance[receiver] += shares;
        lastRedeemRequestId[owner] = epochId;

        if (
            data.length > 0
                && ERC7540Receiver(receiver).onERC7540RedeemReceived(
                    _msgSender(), owner, epochId, data
                ) != ERC7540Receiver.onERC7540RedeemReceived.selector
        ) revert ReceiverFailed();

        emit RedeemRequest(receiver, owner, epochId, _msgSender(), shares);
    }
```
Here `epochs[epochId].redeemRequestBalance[receiver] += shares` It uses the current epoch ID and also the current address of the receiver to so store the balance of shares to be redeemed. 

Here ` lastRedeemRequestId[owner] = epochId` here It stores the current `epochID` using the address of owner.

These are the important state changes to take note for this bug. Now lets go to the `claimrequestredeem` function execution. 
```solidity
function claimRedeem(address receiver)
        public
        whenNotPaused
        returns (uint256 assets)
    {
        return _claimRedeem(_msgSender(), receiver);
    }




 function _claimRedeem(
        address owner,
        address receiver
    )
        internal
        whenNotPaused
        returns (uint256 assets)
    {
        assets = previewClaimRedeem(owner);
        uint256 lastRequestId = lastRedeemRequestId[owner];
        uint256 shares = epochs[lastRequestId].redeemRequestBalance[owner];
        epochs[lastRequestId].redeemRequestBalance[owner] = 0;
        _asset.safeTransferFrom(address(claimableSilo), address(this), assets);
        _asset.transfer(receiver, assets);
        emit ClaimRedeem(lastRequestId, owner, receiver, assets, shares);
    } 
```
It was stated after a conversation with protocol team that receive function is to be called by receiver of the request `requestredeem`
to claim the redeem requested In the case were owner and receiver address are different

 `_claimRedeem` this function is called passing  `msg.sender` and `receiver` as parameters. with `reciever` here being address the receiver wants to claim asset to

It firstly tries to retrieve epochID here `uint256 lastRequestId = lastRedeemRequestId[owner];` however `owner` passed in this function is `msg.sender` which is address of reciever. 

` uint256 shares = epochs[lastRequestId].redeemRequestBalance[owner];` However logic here might look correct since msg.sender who is the reciever was mapped to redeemRequestBalance as it was don in `_createRedeemRequest` It will however return 0 as an invalid epochID which was gotten here ` uint256 shares = epochs[lastRequestId].redeemRequestBalance[owner];` will be passed since a wrong addressed was used to retrieve the Epoch an adressed that was never mapped to any EpochID
## Impact
Receiver will be unable to claim redeem request in situations address of owner and receiver are different.

## Tool used

Manual Review

## Recommendation
Synchronize the address used to in the mapping `mapping(address user => uint256 epochId) public lastRedeemRequestId` to retrieve epochID in both `requestredeem` and `claimrequestredeem`
