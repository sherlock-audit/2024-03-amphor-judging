# Calling `claimRedeem` after `requestRedeem` in the current epoch will lead the user to lose access to their vault shares.

## Summary

Calling `claimRedeem` after `requestRedeem` in the current epoch will lead the user to lose access to their vault shares.

## Vulnerability Detail

`AsyncSynthVault` uses `redeemRequestBalance` to keep track of the redeem requests when the vault is closed, and after settling and the epoch is incremented, users can claim their deposit, but in the case when `isCurrentEpoch` is true `previewClaimRedeem` returns 0, and the redeemRequestBalance is set to 0 `epochs[lastRequestId].redeemRequestBalance[owner] = 0;` and the receiver will not be able to redeem their shares in the future.

## Impact

Depositors will lose their funds and cannot claim them in the future, if they claim in the current epoch.

## Recommendation

Don't allow users to redeem vault shares when the current `lastRedeemRequestId[owner]` is equal to the current `epochId`.
