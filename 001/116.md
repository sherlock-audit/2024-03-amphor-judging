# There is error in creating Redeem Request when owner and receiver are not same which can lead to irredeemable shares

## Summary
 Value of lastRedeemRequestId is set for wrong address when owner and receiver are not same which can lead to shares to get stuck and neither the owner nor the receiver would be able to claimRedeem.

## Vulnerability Detail
Following is _createRedeemRequest function 
```solidity
function _createRedeemRequest(
        uint256 shares,
        address receiver,
        address owner,
        bytes memory data
    )
        internal
    {
        epochs[epochId].redeemRequestBalance[receiver] += shares;
        lastRedeemRequestId[owner] = epochId;

        if (
            data.length > 0
                && ERC7540Receiver(receiver).onERC7540RedeemReceived(
                    _msgSender(), owner, epochId, data
                ) != ERC7540Receiver.onERC7540RedeemReceived.selector
        ) revert ReceiverFailed();

        emit RedeemRequest(receiver, owner, epochId, _msgSender(), shares);
    }
```
Key to note are the following lines 
```solidity
epochs[epochId].redeemRequestBalance[receiver] += shares;
        lastRedeemRequestId[owner] = epochId;
```
As can be seen that the request balance of receiver is increased whereas the lastRedeemRequestId of owner is set whereas it should set the id for receiver because when the claimredeem is called by the receiver of above createredeemrequest (as his balnce is increased so he calls the redeem function) which is as follows
```solidity
function claimRedeem(address receiver)
        public
        whenNotPaused
        returns (uint256 assets)
    {
        return _claimRedeem(_msgSender(), receiver);
    }
 function _claimRedeem(
        address owner,
        address receiver
    )
        internal
        whenNotPaused
        returns (uint256 assets)
    {
        assets = previewClaimRedeem(owner);
        uint256 lastRequestId = lastRedeemRequestId[owner];
        uint256 shares = epochs[lastRequestId].redeemRequestBalance[owner];
        epochs[lastRequestId].redeemRequestBalance[owner] = 0;
        _asset.safeTransferFrom(address(claimableSilo), address(this), assets);
        _asset.transfer(receiver, assets);
        emit ClaimRedeem(lastRequestId, owner, receiver, assets, shares);
    }

 function previewClaimRedeem(address owner) public view returns (uint256) {
        uint256 lastRequestId = lastRedeemRequestId[owner];
        uint256 shares = epochs[lastRequestId].redeemRequestBalance[owner];
        return _convertToAssets(shares, lastRequestId, Math.Rounding.Floor);
    }
```
So not that _claimRedeem is called with msg.sender as the receiver for whom the requestBalnce was increased 
So when the assets are calculated for the receiver which is as follows   assets = previewClaimRedeem(owner);
Note in the previewClaimRedeem calculations are as follows 
uint256 lastRequestId = lastRedeemRequestId[owner]   ==> this will be zero because it was not set for the receiver whose redeemBalance was increased
        uint256 shares = epochs[lastRequestId].redeemRequestBalanc e[owner]; = epochs[0].redeemRequestBalance[owner] = 0

So shares would be zero and the assets will be also zero so the receiver wouldn't be able to claim their shares and also there balance is reduced to zero.
## Impact
Loss of assets for the receiver/owner.

## Tool used

Manual Review

## Recommendation
 lastRedeemRequestId[reveiver] = epochId; i.e redeemRequestId should be set for the reciever instead of the owner.
