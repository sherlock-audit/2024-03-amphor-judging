# Lack of input validation in the `_zapIn` function

## Summary
The `data` input of [_zapIn](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-03-amphor/blob/main/asynchronous-vault/src/VaultZapper.sol#L127) is never validated. 

## Vulnerability Detail
The function [_zapIn](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-03-amphor/blob/main/asynchronous-vault/src/VaultZapper.sol#L127) accepts a parameter `data` which is used as calldata on a low-level call to a whitelisted `target`, the 1inch router:
```solidity
(bool success, bytes memory _data) = target.call{ value: msg.value }(data);
```

The `data` parameter is never validated by the `VaultZapper` contract, this allows: 
- An attacker to swap all the assets currently held by the `VaultZapper` and send them to himself
- Wrong slippage parameter to be passed as input (slippage is calculated incorrectly by `get1InchQuote.js`
- Users to call any function available on the 1inch router
- Users to call the `swap()` function by allowing partial fills

The `VaultZapper` contract is generally not meant to hold funds but because the `data` parameter is not validated users are allowed to use partial fills when swapping on 1inch, which can send back funds to the `VaultZapper` contract. 

## Impact
Attacker can steal assets from the `VaultZapper` contract.

## Recommendation
In [_zapIn](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-03-amphor/blob/main/asynchronous-vault/src/VaultZapper.sol#L127) validate the `data` parameter to check the amount of tokens to be swapped is equal to the `amount` input, validate the slippage and validate that the function called on 1inch is actually the `swap()` function.
