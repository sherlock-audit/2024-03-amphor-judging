# VaultZapper may fail to swap tokens because of wrong allowance check

## Summary

VaultZapper may fail to approve token to router when it needed.

## Vulnerability Detail

When zapper is swapping token, `_transferTokenInAndApprove` is eventually executed and it has following code:
```solidity
if (tokenIn.allowance(_msgSender(), router) < amount) {
    tokenIn.forceApprove(router, amount);
}
```

I believe wrong allowance is checked and intent was to check `allowance(address(this), router)` otherwise why tokens is transferred from user.

## Impact

If user have allowance to the router bigger than swapping amount zap will fail due to insufficient `allowance(address(this), router)`.
