# Users with approvals for routers may not be able to use VaultZapper

## Summary

## Vulnerability Detail


VaultZapper allows users to swap and deposit in the same transaction. To do that, `_transferTokenInAndApprove` transfers the token from the user and executes the swap via the router.

To ensure the swap does not fail due to insufficient allowance, conditional forceApprove is used, but the check uses the sender's allowance and not the VaultZapper's:

```solidity
        if (tokenIn.allowance(_msgSender(), router) < amount) {
            tokenIn.forceApprove(router, amount);
        }
```

This will lead to the following issue:

1. Imagine Alice with zero approval for the router (or any approval < 1000 DAI) uses VaultZapper to swap DAI for USDC and deposit it into USDC vault. `_transferTokenInAndApprove` forceApproves 1000 DAI to the router. Swap of 1000 DAI for USDC is executed. DAI allowance of VaultZapper for the router becomes zero. 

2. Later, Bob, _who uses the router frequently and does not mind approving high amount of DAI for it_, with infinite DAI approval for the router (or any approval >= 2000 DAI) tries to use VaultZapper to swap his 2000 DAI for USDC and deposit into the vault. `forceApprove` is not triggered, so the approval of VaultZapper to the router remains zero, and the swap fails due to insufficient allowance, and transaction reverts.

Note that any user can do what Alice did intentionally, although there's no incentive except griefing.
## Impact
Users who approved a token to a router may be unable to use VaultZapper with these router and token.

## Tool used

Manual Review

## Recommendation
[`approveTokenForRouter`](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-03-amphor/blob/6c797025ffe296e04607abf74400ff2bb36a7de3/asynchronous-vault/src/VaultZapper.sol#L99) is sufficient for approving tokens for routers.
```diff
        tokenIn.safeTransferFrom(_msgSender(), address(this), amount);
-       if (tokenIn.allowance(_msgSender(), router) < amount) {
-           tokenIn.forceApprove(router, amount);
-       }
```
