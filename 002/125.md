# _transferTokenInAndApprove function in VaultZapper.sol checks if condition for wrong address

## Summary
_transferTokenInAndApprove function in VaultZapper.sol checks if condition for msg.sender instead of address(this)

## Vulnerability Detail
Following is _transferTokenInAndApprove function 
```solidity
function _transferTokenInAndApprove(
        address router,
        IERC20 tokenIn,
        uint256 amount
    )
        internal
    {
        tokenIn.safeTransferFrom(_msgSender(), address(this), amount);
        if (tokenIn.allowance(_msgSender(), router) < amount) {
            tokenIn.forceApprove(router, amount);
        }
    }
```
As can be seen that the forceApprove is called on tokenIn by address(this) so as to increase the allowance of router to amount.
So the if condition should be checked for address(this) instead of msg.sender .  If the msg.sender had approved router by given amount then forceApprove would be called and it can cause zap functionality to fails for some cases.
## Impact
For some cases it can cause zap functionality to fail
