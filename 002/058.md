# `VaultZapper::_transferTokenInAndApprove` check allowance in the wrong owner address, which can lead to revert when depositing via `VaultZapper`

## Summary
`VaultZapper::_transferTokenInAndApprove` function should give allowance to the router to transfer from the `VaultZapper` contract, but instead give allowance to transfer from the `msg.sender`

## Vulnerability Detail
In order for a trader to deposit tokens via `VaultZapper::zapAndDeposit` function (or some other functions), trader allows `VaultZapper` contract to transfer tokens from the trader to `VaultZapper`. After that, the  `VaultZapper` contract should give allowance to a router to transfer tokens from `VaultZapper` contract to router. But before doing so, the code checks whether the router has already the allowance. This check `if (tokenIn.allowance(_msgSender(), router) < amount) {` should ask for `address(this)` allowance which is `VaultZapper` contract, not `_msgSender()` which is a trader. If trader has given allowance to the router more than `amount`, router will not have allowance from `VaultZapper` to transfer tokens, thus it will revert 

## Impact
Blocks trader to deposit tokens. unless trader explicitly gives 0 allowance to the router

` if (tokenIn.allowance(_msgSender(), router) < amount) {`

## Tool used

Manual Review

## Recommendation
Replace `_msgSender()` to `address(this)`:

```diff
    function _transferTokenInAndApprove(
        address router,
        IERC20 tokenIn,
        uint256 amount
    )
        internal
    {
        tokenIn.safeTransferFrom(_msgSender(), address(this), amount);
-        if (tokenIn.allowance(_msgSender(), router) < amount) {
+        if (tokenIn.allowance(address(this), router) < amount) {
            tokenIn.forceApprove(router, amount);
        }
    }
```
