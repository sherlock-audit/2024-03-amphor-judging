# underflow risk

## Summary
there's a risk of underflow when subtracting shares from epochs[epochId].redeemRequestBalance[owner] in line 263 in the AsyncSynthVault file


## Vulnerability Detail
there's a risk of underflow when subtracting shares from epochs[epochId].redeemRequestBalance[owner]. If the balance is less than shares, it will result in an underflow, leading to unexpected behavior and potentially allowing the user to redeem more shares than they have.

## Impact

potentially allowing the user to withdraw more assets than they have deposited.

## Code Snippet

`

function
 decreaseRedeemRequest(uint256 shares)
        external
        whenClosed
        whenNotPaused
    {

        address owner = _msgSender();
        uint256 oldBalance = epochs[epochId].redeemRequestBalance[owner];
        epochs[epochId].redeemRequestBalance[owner] -= shares;
        _update(address(pendingSilo), owner, shares);

        emit DecreaseRedeemRequest(
            epochId,
            owner,
            oldBalance,
            epochs[epochId].redeemRequestBalance[owner]
        );
    }

## Tool used

Manual Review

## Recommendation
To prevent underflow, you should add a check to ensure that the balance is sufficient before subtracting shares.
