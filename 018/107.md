# There's a risk of underflow

## Summary
### **There's a risk of underflow which causes the wrong performance of the contract and withdrawal of more of the user's original balance**

## Vulnerability Detail
in the AsyncSynthVault file and in the decreaseDepositRequest function when subtracting assets from epochs[epochId].depositRequestBalance[owner]. If the balance is less than assets, it will result in an underflow, leading to unexpected behavior and potentially allowing the user to withdraw more assets than they have deposited.

## Impact
potentially allowing the user to withdraw more assets than they have deposited.

## Code Snippet

        `    function decreaseDepositRequest(uint256 assets)
        external
        whenClosed
        whenNotPaused
    {
        address owner = _msgSender();
        uint256 oldBalance = epochs[epochId].depositRequestBalance[owner];
        epochs[epochId].depositRequestBalance[owner] -= assets;
        _asset.safeTransferFrom(address(pendingSilo), owner, assets);

        emit DecreaseDepositRequest(
            epochId,
            owner,
            oldBalance,
            epochs[epochId].depositRequestBalance[owner]
        );
      `
## Tool used

Manual Review

## Recommendation
To prevent underflow, you should add a check to ensure that the balance is sufficient before subtracting assets.
