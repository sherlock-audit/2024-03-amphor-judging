# Incorrect interface used in the `AsyncSynthVault::_createDepositRequest` function which may lead to failure of an expected value upon execution of the callback.

## Summary

The audit  was conducted to review the ERC7540Receiver interface implementation within the asyncSynthVault contract. The interface defined the `onERC7540DepositReceived` function which is expected to have five input parameters according to the EIP-7540 standard. However, upon inspection it was found that `onERC7540DepositReceived` function within the `asyncSynthVault::_createDepositRequest` function is missing one input field potentially causing issues with compliance and functionality.

## Vulnerability Detail

1. Missing Input Param in `onERC7540DepositReceived` function.

Description: The `onERC7540DepositReceived` function within `asyncSynthVault::_createDepositRequest` function is missing the assets input parameter, which is a required parameter according to the ERC7540 standard.

## Impact

The absence of these input parameter in the `onERC7540DepositReceived` function can have the following impacts:

1. Failure to return the expected value `(0x6d7e2da0)` for the `onERC7540DepositReceived` function upon successful execution of the callback according to the docs [https://eips.ethereum.org/EIPS/eip-7540](EIP-7540).

## Code Snippet

In the `ERC7540Receiver` interface in `ERC7540Receiver.sol`

```javascript
function onERC7540DepositReceived(
        address operator,
        address owner,
        uint256 requestId,
@>        // Missing input field --> uint256 assets,
        bytes memory data
    )
        external
        returns (bytes4);

```

The interface being used in the `AsyncSynthVault::_createDepositRequest` function 

```javascript
function _createDepositRequest(
        uint256 assets,
        address receiver,
        address owner,
        bytes memory data
    )
        internal
    {
        epochs[epochId].depositRequestBalance[receiver] += assets;
        if (lastDepositRequestId[receiver] != epochId) {
            lastDepositRequestId[receiver] = epochId;
        }

        if (
            data.length > 0
@>                && ERC7540Receiver(receiver).onERC7540DepositReceived(
                    // Missing one more parameter
                    _msgSender(), owner, epochId, data
                ) != ERC7540Receiver.onERC7540DepositReceived.selector
        ) revert ReceiverFailed();


        emit DepositRequest(receiver, owner, epochId, _msgSender(), assets);
    }

```

## Tool used

Manual Review

## Recommendation

1. Interface Update.

Amend the `ERC7540Receiver` interface to include the missing input parameter `assets` for the function `onERC7540DepositReceived`.

Ensure compliance with the `ERC7540` standard by updating the interface as follows:

In the `ERC7540Receiver` interface in `ERC7540Receiver.sol` for the `onERC7540DepositReceived` function add the assets param.

```diff

function onERC7540DepositReceived(
        address operator,
        address owner,
        uint256 requestId,
+      uint256 assets,
        bytes memory data
    )
        external
        returns (bytes4);
        
```

2. Code Adjustment.

Update the `AsyncSynthVault::_createDepositRequest` function to reflect the changes in the `ERC7540Receiver` interface.

```diff
function _createDepositRequest(
        uint256 assets,
        address receiver,
        address owner,
        bytes memory data
    )
        internal
    {
        epochs[epochId].depositRequestBalance[receiver] += assets;
        if (lastDepositRequestId[receiver] != epochId) {
            lastDepositRequestId[receiver] = epochId;
        }

        if (
-            data.length > 0
-                && ERC7540Receiver(receiver).onERC7540DepositReceived(
-                    _msgSender(), owner, epochId, data
+            data.length > 0
+               && ERC7540Receiver(receiver).onERC7540DepositReceived(
+                  _msgSender(), owner, epochId, assets, data
                ) != ERC7540Receiver.onERC7540DepositReceived.selector
        ) revert ReceiverFailed();
       
        emit DepositRequest(receiver, owner, epochId, _msgSender(), assets);
    }

```

And then finally verify that the function now return the expected value `(0x6d7e2da0)` for the `onERC7540DepositReceived` function upon successful execution of the callback according to the docs [https://eips.ethereum.org/EIPS/eip-7540](EIP-7540).
