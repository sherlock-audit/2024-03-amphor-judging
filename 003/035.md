# Transfer used instead of safeTransfer for `_claimRedeem`

## Summary

The transfer used instead of `safeTransfer`, which doesn't check whether it was a successful transfer

## Vulnerability Detail
[Transfer](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-03-amphor/blob/main/asynchronous-vault/src/AsyncSynthVault.sol#L771) used instead of `safeTransfer`, which doesn't check whether it was a successful transfer. It can cause that assets won't be sent to the user, but Vault would account for that they were transferred.


## Impact

Lost funds

## Code Snippet

```solidity
function _claimRedeem(
        address owner,
        address receiver
    )
        internal
        whenNotPaused
        returns (uint256 assets)
    {
        assets = previewClaimRedeem(owner);
        uint256 lastRequestId = lastRedeemRequestId[owner];
        uint256 shares = epochs[lastRequestId].redeemRequestBalance[owner];
        epochs[lastRequestId].redeemRequestBalance[owner] = 0;
        _asset.safeTransferFrom(address(claimableSilo), address(this), assets);
        _asset.transfer(receiver, assets);
        emit ClaimRedeem(lastRequestId, owner, receiver, assets, shares);
    }
 ```

## Tool used

Manual Review

## Recommendation

Two options use `safeTransfer`
```diff
function _claimRedeem(
        address owner,
        address receiver
    )
        internal
        whenNotPaused
        returns (uint256 assets)
    {
        assets = previewClaimRedeem(owner);
        uint256 lastRequestId = lastRedeemRequestId[owner];
        uint256 shares = epochs[lastRequestId].redeemRequestBalance[owner];
        epochs[lastRequestId].redeemRequestBalance[owner] = 0;
        _asset.safeTransferFrom(address(claimableSilo), address(this), assets);
-       _asset.transfer(receiver, assets);
+       _asset.safeTransfer(receiver, assets);
        emit ClaimRedeem(lastRequestId, owner, receiver, assets, shares);
    }
 ```
But more gas efficient would be to call safeTransferFrom in one step and send asset directly to the user. This is the option I recommend
```diff
function _claimRedeem(
        address owner,
        address receiver
    )
        internal
        whenNotPaused
        returns (uint256 assets)
    {
        assets = previewClaimRedeem(owner);
        uint256 lastRequestId = lastRedeemRequestId[owner];
        uint256 shares = epochs[lastRequestId].redeemRequestBalance[owner];
        epochs[lastRequestId].redeemRequestBalance[owner] = 0;
-       _asset.safeTransferFrom(address(claimableSilo), address(this), assets);
-       _asset.transfer(receiver, assets);
+       _asset.safeTransferFrom(address(claimableSilo), receiver, assets);
        emit ClaimRedeem(lastRequestId, owner, receiver, assets, shares);
    }
 ```
