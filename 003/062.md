# The `_claimRedeem` function carries out asset transfers to users in an unsafe manner.

## Summary
The  `_claimRedeem` firstly implements a wrong design of sending assets to vault before sending to the reciever. In addition to that It does this transfer from vault to user in an unsafe manner `_asset.transfer(receiver, assets)` without checking return values. Protocol even uses usdt which return no values on failure thus can fail silently.

## Vulnerability Detail
```solidity
function _claimRedeem(
        address owner,
        address receiver
    )
        internal
        whenNotPaused
        returns (uint256 assets)
    {
        assets = previewClaimRedeem(owner);
        uint256 lastRequestId = lastRedeemRequestId[owner];
        uint256 shares = epochs[lastRequestId].redeemRequestBalance[owner];
        epochs[lastRequestId].redeemRequestBalance[owner] = 0;
        _asset.safeTransferFrom(address(claimableSilo), address(this), assets);
 >>    _asset.transfer(receiver, assets);
        emit ClaimRedeem(lastRequestId, owner, receiver, assets, shares);
    }

```
This function unnecessarily sends token to the contract instead of sending directly to users with the `_asset.safeTransferFrom` above
and then does an unsafe transfer to receiver `_asset.transfer(receiver, assets);`

## Impact
risk of uncaught failed transfer and risk of loss of funds to users as state will be updated with no actual transfer made

## Tool used

Manual Review

## Recommendation
send asset directly to reciever with the transfer from 
`+  _asset.safeTransferFrom(address(claimableSilo), reciever, assets);`
