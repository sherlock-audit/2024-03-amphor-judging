# Use safeTransfer  rather than transfer

## Summary
Use safeTransfer rather than transfer

## Vulnerability Detail
this function uses transfer which is not safe
https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-03-amphor/blob/main/asynchronous-vault/src/AsyncSynthVault.sol#L771

it does not check the return value, nor does it work with all legacy tokens.

Tokens not compliant with the ERC20 specification could return false from the transfer function call to indicate the transfer fails, while the calling contract would not notice the failure if the return value is not checked. 

## Impact
Tokens that don't actually perform the transfer and return false are still counted as a correct transfer. Furthermore, tokens that do not correctly implement the EIP20 standard, like USDT which does not return a success boolean, will revert.

## Code Snippet
```solidity
function _claimRedeem(
        address owner,
        address receiver
    )
        internal
        whenNotPaused
        returns (uint256 assets)
    {
        assets = previewClaimRedeem(owner);
        uint256 lastRequestId = lastRedeemRequestId[owner];
        uint256 shares = epochs[lastRequestId].redeemRequestBalance[owner];
        epochs[lastRequestId].redeemRequestBalance[owner] = 0;
        _asset.safeTransferFrom(address(claimableSilo), address(this), assets);
        _asset.transfer(receiver, assets);
        emit ClaimRedeem(lastRequestId, owner, receiver, assets, shares);
    }
```
