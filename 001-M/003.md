# Incorrect allowance checking in the _transferTokenInAndApprove function

## Summary
An incorrect allowance check in the _transferTokenInAndApprove function may cause the token exchange to fail and cause the entire function to REVERT.

## Vulnerability Detail
In the _transferTokenInAndApprove function of the VaultZapper contract, firstly the required tokens will be transferred into this contract, after which the approve operation will be performed on the router contract after the allowance quantity check.

However, in the allowance check, it is the msg.sender's allowance to the router that is checked rather than the number of allowances to the router in this contract.

This leads to the fact that if msg.sender has previously been approved the router address (and its allowance number is greater than amount), then it will directly skip the operation of the VaultZapper contract to approve the router address. This ultimately causes the _executeZap function to fail due to insufficient allowance and thus the entire transaction will be revert.(In the case where the current VaultZapper contract's allowance to the router address is less than the amount)

## Impact
Causes the _executeZap function to fail and cause the entire transaction to be revert.

## Recommendation
It is suggested to change msg.sender in the check to address(this).
