# Wrong allowance check on the vault zapper

## Summary
Wrong allowance check might prevent some users from being able to use the `VaultZapper` contract.

## Vulnerability Detail
The 1inch router needs to be approved by the vault zapper contract in order to be able to transfers assets to itself to perform the swap. The allowance is checked in the function [_transferTokenInAndApprove](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-03-amphor/blob/main/asynchronous-vault/src/VaultZapper.sol#L160) as follows:
```solidity
if (tokenIn.allowance(_msgSender(), router) < amount) {
    tokenIn.forceApprove(router, amount);
}
```
This is incorrect because `VaultZapper` approves the router for `amount` when the allowance of the sender to the router is lower than `amount`. This can lead to the `VaultZapper` not working for some users because the allowance is not enough. Users that allowed the 1inch router to transfer tokens from them, so `tokenIn.allowance(_msgSender(), router) < amount` returning `false`, can't use the vault zapper unless they remove their allowance from the 1inch router.

## Impact
Some users might not be able to use the `VaultZapper` contract.

## Recommendation
Change [_transferTokenInAndApprove](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-03-amphor/blob/main/asynchronous-vault/src/VaultZapper.sol#L160) to:
```solidity
tokenIn.safeTransferFrom(_msgSender(), address(this), amount);
if (tokenIn.allowance(address(this), router) < amount) {
    tokenIn.forceApprove(router, amount);
}
```
