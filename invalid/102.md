# AsyncSynthVault smart contract isn't compatible with EIP7540

## Summary
AsyncSynthVault smart contract isn't compatible with EIP7540

## Vulnerability Detail
When a user creates a deposit request, they specify the `receiver` and data parameters. If `data.length > 0`, a call is made to the receiver with the `onERC7540DepositReceived` function.

Here is how the `onERC7540DepositReceived` and `onERC7540RedeemReceived` functions look in the `ERC7540Receiver` interface:
```solidity
function onERC7540DepositReceived(
        address operator,
        address owner,
        uint256 requestId,
        bytes memory data
    ) external returns (bytes4);

    function onERC7540RedeemReceived(
        address operator,
        address owner,
        uint256 requestId,
        bytes memory data
    ) external returns (bytes4);
```

However, in [EIP-7540](https://eips.ethereum.org/EIPS/eip-7540#request-callbacks), the signature of these functions is as follows:
```solidity
function onERC7540DepositReceived(
        address operator,
        address owner,
        uint256 requestId,
        uint256 assets,
        bytes memory data
    ) external returns (bytes4);

function onERC7540RedeemReceived(
        address operator,
        address owner,
        uint256 requestId,
         uint256 assets,
        bytes memory data
    ) external returns (bytes4);
```

## Impact

Smart contracts that successfully implement EIP-7540 will return the correct selector, but the transaction will fail.

## Tool used

Manual Review

## Recommendation

Consider changing the above functions as follows:
```diff
function onERC7540DepositReceived(
        address operator,
        address owner,
        uint256 requestId,
+       uint256 assets,
        bytes memory data
    ) external returns (bytes4);

    function onERC7540RedeemReceived(
        address operator,
        address owner,
        uint256 requestId,
+       uint256 assets,
        bytes memory data
    ) external returns (bytes4);
```
