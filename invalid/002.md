# VaultZapper.sol#_executePermit() - front-runnable permit is a part of the call chain

## Summary
The function ``_executePermit()`` just straight forward executes a permit call, before initiating a deposit/request/claim on a vault. It is the first step in the call chain and is open for a short-term DoS.
*This is present in the other contracts with permit functions aswell*

## Vulnerability Detail
The ``_executePermit()`` is part of ``zapAndClaimAndRequestDepositWithPermit``, ``zapAndRequestDepositWithPermit``, ``zapAndDepositWithPermit`` as the first step if the allowance of the sender is not enough. Even though permits are safe and front-running only in the context of the permit are not harmful at all, they are prone to front-running when they are a part of a call chain as it is the case here. As the permit's signature is public it can be front-ran and the nonce can be used up, meaning that the the permit call in the above listed functions would revert the entire call, since the nonce would already be used up.

## Impact
A short-term, but highly likely and easily repeatable DoS

## Tool used

Manual Review

## Recommendation
As recommended in the above article, wrap the permit call in a try-catch block. 
P.S The argument that the user can call the function directly if this happens is not a sufficient solution, since the functions can be basically unusable :)
