# User can manipulate settle values in AsyncSynthVault

## Summary
Before a user can claim shares (before the `settle` function is called by the owner), they can create requests for deposit and redeem, or decrease deposit and redeem. This means they can increase or decrease shares and assets in `pendingSilo` at any time, which can affect the `settle` function.

## Vulnerability Detail

When `settle` is called, the owner passes a new value for `newSavedBalance`, based on which the pending shares and pending assets are calculated to determine how many new shares and assets will be issued.

```solidity
address pendingSiloAddr = address(pendingSilo);
        uint256 pendingRedeem = balanceOf(pendingSiloAddr);
        uint256 pendingDeposit = _asset.balanceOf(pendingSiloAddr);

        uint256 sharesToMint = pendingDeposit.mulDiv(
            totalSupply + 1,
            _lastSavedBalance + 1,
            Math.Rounding.Floor
        );
```

Because a user can increase or decrease shares or assets in `pendingSilo` at any time and front-run the `settle` transaction, `sharesToMint` and other important values can be manipulated for the user's benefit.

## Impact
Shares can be manipulated for the user's benefit.

## Tool used

Manual Review

## Recommendation


Consider choosing one of the following recommendations:

1) Delete the `decreaseDepositRequest` or `decreaseRedeemRequest` functions.
2) Add a fee so that the user can call the `decreaseDepositRequest` or `decreaseRedeemRequest` functions.
