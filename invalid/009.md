# `_claimRedeem` uses `transfer` instead of `safeTransfer`.

## Summary

It is always recommended to use `safeTransfer` over `transfer`, and additionally check the return value to ensure the transfer was successful.

## Vulnerability Detail

When invoking [`_claimRedeem(address,address)`](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-03-amphor/blob/6c797025ffe296e04607abf74400ff2bb36a7de3/asynchronous-vault/src/AsyncSynthVault.sol#L758), the amount of [`_asset`](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-03-amphor/blob/6c797025ffe296e04607abf74400ff2bb36a7de3/asynchronous-vault/src/SyncSynthVault.sol#L106) determined to belong to the `receiver` is transferred using an unchecked `transfer`:

```solidity
_asset.safeTransferFrom(address(claimableSilo), address(this), assets);
_asset.transfer(receiver, assets); /// @audit unchecked_transfer
emit ClaimRedeem(lastRequestId, owner, receiver, assets, shares);
```

Notice here that the boolean `success` flag after calling `transfer` is not inspected, meaning that even though the transfer of the underlying asset to the `receiver` could have failed, the redeem operation would have been considered the operation implicitly successful, instead of triggering a `revert`.

This could cause the `receiver` their loss of due underlying [`_asset`](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-03-amphor/blob/6c797025ffe296e04607abf74400ff2bb36a7de3/asynchronous-vault/src/SyncSynthVault.sol#L106).

## Code Snippet

```solidity
function _claimRedeem(
    address owner,
    address receiver
)
    internal
    whenNotPaused
    returns (uint256 assets)
{
    assets = previewClaimRedeem(owner);
    uint256 lastRequestId = lastRedeemRequestId[owner];
    uint256 shares = epochs[lastRequestId].redeemRequestBalance[owner];
    epochs[lastRequestId].redeemRequestBalance[owner] = 0;
    _asset.safeTransferFrom(address(claimableSilo), address(this), assets);
    _asset.transfer(receiver, assets);
    emit ClaimRedeem(lastRequestId, owner, receiver, assets, shares);
}
```

## Tool used

Manual Review

## Recommendation

Use `safeTransfer` in consistency with the rest of the codebase:

```diff
function _claimRedeem(
    address owner,
    address receiver
)
    internal
    whenNotPaused
    returns (uint256 assets)
{
    assets = previewClaimRedeem(owner);
    uint256 lastRequestId = lastRedeemRequestId[owner];
    uint256 shares = epochs[lastRequestId].redeemRequestBalance[owner];
    epochs[lastRequestId].redeemRequestBalance[owner] = 0;
    _asset.safeTransferFrom(address(claimableSilo), address(this), assets);
-   _asset.transfer(receiver, assets);
+   _asset.safeTransfer(receiver, assets);
    emit ClaimRedeem(lastRequestId, owner, receiver, assets, shares);
}
```
