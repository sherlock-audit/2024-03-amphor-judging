# Fee-on-transfer tokens not supported

## Summary
deposit & mint functions don't support fee on transfer tokens which can be USDC & USDT which are specified in the docs

## Vulnerability Detail
The `SyncSynthVault::deposit` , `SyncSynthVault::mint` & `AsyncSynthVault::requestDeposit` functions do not work well with fee-on-transfer tokens as the assets variable is the pre-fee amount, including the fee, whereas the `totalAssets` do not include the fee anymore.

## Impact
The amount of assets deposited & minted won't be correct. This impacts all further calculations and can be exploited to mint more assets.

## Tool used
Manual Review

## Recommendation
Consider comparing before and after balance to get the actual transferred amount.
