# Potential DOS Vulnerability via Permit Frontrunning in ERC20Permit Implementation

## Summary
The ERC20 `permit` function reveals a potential Denial of Service (DOS) vulnerability. Specifically, frontrunning a permit call can cause the contract's intended permit to fail.

## Vulnerability Detail
The contract utilizes the `permit` function from the ERC20Permit extension, allowing approvals to be made via signatures. This feature is detailed in the ERC20Permit OpenZeppelin implementation and is designed to change an account's ERC20 allowance without sending a transaction. However, because permits can be frontrun and submitted by anyone, a malicious actor can frontrun a `permit` call with invalid parameters, causing the contract's legitimate permit request to fail.

This vulnerability arises from the contract's assumption that `permit` calls will always succeed if properly signed and executed. However, the inherent risk of frontrunning in public blockchains can lead to situations where this assumption does not hold, potentially blocking legitimate contract interactions.

## Impact
If exploited, this vulnerability can prevent the contract from executing legitimate permit requests, effectively causing a DOS condition. This could disrupt normal contract operations and impact user transactions relying on the permit functionality.

## Tool used
Manual Review

## Recommendation
It is recommended to implement a try/catch mechanism around the permit calls to gracefully handle failures due to frontrunning. Additionally, considering alternative entry points that do not rely solely on permit for operations can enhance the contract's resilience against such attacks. Adopting a pattern similar to the one suggested in the [1]ERC20Permit OpenZeppelin documentation, which involves using msg.sender for clarity and allowing permit calls to fail safely, can mitigate the risks associated with this vulnerability.
