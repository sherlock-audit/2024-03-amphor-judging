# Add Gap in Upgradeable Contracts with Inherited contract

## Summary
Any Upgradeable contract with some inherited contracts, inherited contracts should have some gap to avoid conflict when new variables are added

## Vulnerability Detail

## Impact

No Gap will allow no space to add new variables in the new inherited contract or the storage slot of some variables get overwritten and cause many complex issues

## Code Snippet
https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-03-amphor/blob/main/asynchronous-vault/src/SyncSynthVault.sol#L160

```solidity
 uint16 public feesInBps;
    uint16 internal _maxDrawdown; // guardrail
    IERC20 internal _asset; // underlying asset
    bool public vaultIsOpen; // vault is open or closed
    uint256 public lastSavedBalance; // last saved balance
```

## Tool used

Manual Review

## Recommendation
Add storage gap to the SyncSynthVault contract
