# Admin rug vectors

## Summary

Centralization vulnerabilities are present in the protocol, which could lead to the theft of user tokens/funds.

## Vulnerability Detail

In the `VaultZapper.sol` contract, the owner possesses significant control over the protocol and multiple means to deny or steal users' funds. Consequently, a malicious or compromised admin can steal all user funds either by directly calling the `VaultZapper::withdrawToken` or `VaultZapper::withdrawNativeToken` functions, or by setting a malicious router through the usage of `VaultZapper::approveTokenForRouter` functions to drain user funds. Since users' funds are directly at risk, the Impact is considered High, with a Medium likelihood, as it requires a malicious or compromised admin, but the incentives are high. The issue is marked as a high severity issue.

## Impact

Users could lose their funds, and such hack could negatively impact the protocol's reputation.

## Tool used

Manual Review

## Recommendation

Redesign all methods that can be exploited for rug pulls, and consider making the admin a Timelock contract to mitigate these risks.
