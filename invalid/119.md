# Missing Blacklist Validation in `withdrawToken` Function

## Summary
Blacklist address would not receive any token.

## Vulnerability Detail
The vulnerability in the `withdrawToken` function lies in its lack of validation for the recipient address against a blacklist. Without this validation, the function allows the owner of the contract to transfer tokens, including `USDT`

## Impact
The contract owner can transfer tokens, such as `USDT`, to addresses that have been blacklisted. The address that should not receive the any tokens.

## Code Snippet
```solidity
 function withdrawToken(IERC20 token) external onlyOwner {
        token.safeTransfer(_msgSender(), token.balanceOf(address(this)));
    }
```

## Tool used
Manual Review

## Recommendation
Add parameter for `recipient` address
```solidity
function withdrawToken(IERC20 token, address recipient) external onlyOwner {
    token.safeTransfer(recipient, token.balanceOf(address(this)));
}
```
