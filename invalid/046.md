# No storage gap for upgradeable contracts can lead to storage collision

## Summary
Storage of `AsyncSynthVault` might be corrupted during an upgrade.

## Vulnerability Detail
For an upgradeable contract, there must exist a storage gap to allow adding new state variables. Without a storage gap, the variable in the child contract might be overwritten by the upgraded base contract, if new variables are added to the base contract.

Refer to this article: https://docs.openzeppelin.com/upgrades-plugins/1.x/writing-upgradeable

For example `AsyncSynthVault` inherits from `SyncSynthVault`, which doesn't have storage gaps. If in a future upgrade, additional variable is added to `SyncSynthVault` contract, then that variable would overwrite `epochId` inside `AsyncSynthVault` leading to unintended consequences.

## Impact
Storage of `AsyncSynthVault` might be corrupted during an upgrade, causing vaults to be broken.

Manual Review

## Recommendation
Consider adding appropriate storage gaps at the end of upgradeable smart contracts. Please refer to OpenZeppelin documentation
