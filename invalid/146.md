# Functions with permit in vaults can be affected by DOS

## Summary
Vaults supports permit functions which can be affected by DOS making them revert.
## Vulnerability Detail
The `depositWithPermit` function is used to deposit underlying assets into the vault using a permit for approval.
```solidity
function depositWithPermit(
        uint256 assets,
        address receiver,
        PermitParams calldata permitParams
    )
        external
        returns (uint256)
    {
        if (_asset.allowance(msg.sender, address(this)) < assets) {
            execPermit(_msgSender(), address(this), permitParams);
        }
        return deposit(assets, receiver);
    }
```
But while the transactions for  `depositWithPermit` is in mempool, anyone could extract the signature parameters from the call. As the permit is already been used, the call will revert making whole txn revert. Thus making the victim not able to make successful deposit using permit.
## Impact
Users will not be able to use the permit functions for important actions

Manual Review

## Recommendation
Recomended to wrap the permit calls in a try-catch block.
