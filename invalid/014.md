# depositWithPermit Functionality Limited to Permit Creator Only

## Summary

The `depositWithPermit` function in the SyncSynthVault contract is designed to leverage ERC-20 token permits for depositing tokens into the vault. However, due to a flaw in current implementation, only the signer of the permit can call this function, which contradicts the intended use of permits.

## Vulnerability Detail

The `depositWithPermit` function is intended to allow a user to give permission to another entity (typically a contract) to deposit on their behalf using a signed message (permit). The current implementation restricts this functionality because it requires the permit signer to be the same as the message sender (**msg.sender**), which defeats the purpose of the permit system.

The `execPermit` function should verify that the permit was signed by the owner (the actual owner of the funds) and not necessarily the **msg.sender**. The contract should be modified to accept a permit from any signer and then allow any entity to perform the deposit using that permit, as long as the permit is valid and the receiver matches the intended beneficiary specified in the permit.

## Impact

This implementation error restricts the functionality of the permit system, preventing third-party contracts or users from depositing on behalf of the permit signer. 

## Code Snippet

## PoC

Consider a following scenario 

1. Alice wants to deposit tokens into the SyncSynthVault without directly interacting with the contract. She signs a permit granting the vault contract permission to transfer her tokens.
2. Alice sends the signed permit to Bob, who is a service provider that handles deposits.
3. Bob attempts to call depositWithPermit using Alice's permit to deposit tokens into the vault on her behalf.
4. The transaction fails because Bob is not the signer of the permit, even though he has a valid permit from Alice.

## Tool used

Manual Review

## Recommendation

The depositWithPermit function should be modified to accept a permit from any signer and allow any entity (msg.sender) to perform the deposit using that permit, as long as the permit is valid.

- Add an owner field to the PermitParams struct to explicitly specify the permit signer.
- Update the depositWithPermit function to use the owner from PermitParams when calling execPermit.

```diff
struct PermitParams {
+    address owner; // Signer of the permit
    uint256 value;
    uint256 deadline;
    uint8 v;
    bytes32 r;
    bytes32 s;
}
```
```diff
function depositWithPermit(
    uint256 assets,
    address receiver,
    PermitParams calldata permitParams
)
    external
    returns (uint256)
{
    // Use the permit signer's address for the permit execution
-     execPermit(_msgSender(), address(this), permitParams);
+    execPermit(permitParams.owner, address(this), permitParams);
    // Continue with the deposit process
    return deposit(assets, receiver);
}
```
