# EIP7540 non-compliance

## Summary
Ð¡ontract `AsyncSynthVault.sol` does not comply with the EIP7540 specification.

## Vulnerability Detail
Following the EIP7540 documentation: 
"All methods which initiate a request (including requestId==0) include a data parameter, which if nonzero length MUST send a callback to the receiver.
There are two interfaces, `ERC7540DepositReceiver` and `ERC7540RedeemReceiver` which each define the single callback method to be called."
These interfaces MUST receive next parameters:
```solidity
 inputs:
    - name: operator
      type: address
    - name: owner
      type: address
    - name: requestId
      type: uint256
    - name: assets
      type: uint256
    - name: data
      type: bytes
```
However, in Amphor's realization of these interfaces parameter `assets` is missed.
```solidity
 if (
            data.length > 0
                && ERC7540Receiver(receiver).onERC7540DepositReceived(
                    _msgSender(), owner, epochId, data
                ) != ERC7540Receiver.onERC7540DepositReceived.selector
        ) revert ReceiverFailed();
```
## Impact
`AsyncSynthVault.sol` is incompatible with eip7540.

## Recommendation
```diff
 if (
            data.length > 0
                && ERC7540Receiver(receiver).onERC7540DepositReceived(
                   _msgSender(), 
                   owner,  
                   epochId, 
+                  assets
                   data
                ) != ERC7540Receiver.onERC7540DepositReceived.selector
        ) revert ReceiverFailed();
