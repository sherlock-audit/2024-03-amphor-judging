# The `SyncSynthVault` implementation is vulnerable to inflation attacks

## Summary
The current implementation of the `SyncSynthVault::deposit` function can lead to the loss of assets for some users

## Vulnerability Detail
The `AsyncSynthVault` contract inherits the `SyncSynthVault` abstract contract. Due to the way that it is currently implemented, the `SyncSynthVault::deposit` function (which is not overrided in `AsyncSynthVault`) is vulnerable to the infamous "vault inflation attack". Although it does use virtual shares, just like the OpenZeppelin ERC4626 implementation, since those are always fixed to the value of 1, they will not suffice in preventing the attack from happening.

To illustrate how this can be exploited, let's take an example: 

1. Bob sends a transaction to deposit 1000 USDC into the Amphor vault.
2. Unfortunately for him, Alice has been carefully monitoring the mempool, so after she sees his transaction, she frontruns it with two transactions of her own - one that deposits 100 USDC into the vault (which she receives 100 shares for) and another that directly transfers 1001 USDC to it (which brings up its share price from 1 to 1001 USDC).
3. The transaction of Bob gets executed - He receives 0 shares for his deposit
4. Now Alice executes another transaction that redeems all of her shares - She receives 100 ร 2102 รท 101 = **2081 shares**

Although it is stated in the contest README that the protocol team intends to "bootstrap" their vaults by depositing into the vaults first themselves in order to protect against that attack, this will actually have the opposite effect for them - Instead of protecting their protocol against the attack, they themself will most likely get exploited when performing the bootstrap deposits.

## Impact
Some users might receive less/no shares when depositing their assets into the vault

## Tool used
Manual Review

## Recommendation
Revert when the `sharesAmount` is equal to 0. Additionally, you might also want to increase the virtual shares count.
