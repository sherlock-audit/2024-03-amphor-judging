# Missing access control in `AsyncSynthVault#settle`

## Summary

## Vulnerability Detail
As long as the owner has enough tokens approved to the vault, anyone at any moment can `settle` the current epoch with any `newSavedBalance` (as long at it passes `_checkMaxDrawdown`), marking a loss or a gain for all deposit and withdrawal requests of that epoch, and immediately making all requested deposits and withdrawals claimable.
## Impact
1. If `newSavedBalance < lastSavedBalance`, loss of value for redeems requested during the epoch that was settled by the attacker, gain of value for requested deposits. The impact is the opposite if `newSavedBalance > lastSavedBalance`.
2. Deposit/redeem requests of the current epoch can be claimed immediately.

## Recommendation
Add `onlyOwner` modifier to the `settle` function.
