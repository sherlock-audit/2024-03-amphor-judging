# Imperfect defense mechanism against inflation attack

## Summary
Imperfect defense mechanism against inflation attack

## Vulnerability Detail
The documentation mentions:

"We will boostrap the vault to avoid inflation attack so please take this into consideration."
For weth vault it would be 1 weth.
For usdc vault it would be 1000 usdc.

This still cannot reasonably defend against inflation attacks.

1. The way the `SyncSynthVault::_convertToShares` function  calculates shares is:`assets.mulDiv(totalSupply() + 1, totalAssets() + 1, rounding);` https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-03-amphor/blob/main/asynchronous-vault/src/SyncSynthVault.sol#L568-L585 
```solidity
    /**
     * @dev Internal conversion function (from assets to shares) with support
     * for rounding direction.
     * @param assets Theunderlying assets amount to be converted into shares.
     * @param rounding The rounding direction.
     * @return Amount of shares received in exchange of the specified underlying
     * assets amount.
     */
    function _convertToShares(
        uint256 assets,
        Math.Rounding rounding
    )
        internal
        view
        returns (uint256)
    {
        return assets.mulDiv(totalSupply() + 1, totalAssets() + 1, rounding);
    }
```

**Virtual shares are not introduced here to increase the attacker’s attack costs.**

2. In the `SyncSynthVault::deposit` function, https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-03-amphor/blob/main/asynchronous-vault/src/SyncSynthVault.sol#L291-L317

```solidity
    /**
     * @dev See {IERC4626-deposit}
     * @notice The `deposit` function is used to deposit underlying assets into
     * the vault.
     * @param assets The underlying assets amount to be converted into shares.
     * @param receiver The address of the shares receiver.
     * @return Amount of shares received in exchange of the
     * specified underlying assets amount.
     */
    function deposit(
        uint256 assets,
        address receiver
    )
        public
        whenNotPaused
        returns (uint256)
    {
        uint256 maxAssets = maxDeposit(receiver);
        if (assets > maxAssets) {
            revert ERC4626ExceededMaxDeposit(receiver, assets, maxAssets);
        }

        uint256 sharesAmount = previewDeposit(assets);
        _deposit(_msgSender(), receiver, assets, sharesAmount);

        return sharesAmount;
    }
```

**If the calculated sharesAmount is 0, there is no revert**

Although both weth vault and usdc vault will be boostrapped, the initialized amount is not enough to defend against inflation attack.

## Tool used

Manual Review

## Recommendation
On this basis, two new checks should be added:

1. If the user deposits, share calculation returns zero, then revert directly
5. Add a virtual shares mechanism to increase the attacker's cost, so that the numerator in the share calculation formula `assets * totalSupply +1eVirtualOffset / totalAssets +1` will be raised by us. If the attacker wants to raise the denominator of totalAssets through malicious donations , then he will pay a greater cost
