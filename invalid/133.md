# Frontrunning Vulnerability in `SyncSynthVault.sol`

## Summary
Contract: `SyncSynthVault.sol`

Affected Functions: 
- `_deposit(address caller, address receiver, uint256 assets, uint256 shares)`
- `_withdraw(address caller, address receiver, address owner, uint256 assets, uint256 shares)`

After review, it was observed that contract does not implement mechanisms to prevent transaction order manipulation.

The `SyncSynthVault` contract's susceptibility to frontrunning arises from the transparency of the Ethereum mempool, where pending transactions can be seen by potential attackers. 
 

## Vulnerability Detail
 The `_deposit` function is used to deposit the specified underlying assets amount in exchange of a proportionnal amount of shares. 
The function `_withdraw` is used to withdraw the specified underlying assets amount in exchange of a proportionnal amount of shares.
Since these functions directly impact the contract's state and could influence asset pricing, they are prime targets for frontrunning.

### POC

https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-03-amphor/blob/main/asynchronous-vault/src/SyncSynthVault.sol#L359
Lets assume:  
1. Alice is about to make a large deposit into the vault, which is likely to cause a significant price impact. 
2. Bob, a malicious actor, is monitoring the mempool and sees Alice's pending transaction. 
3. Before Alice's transaction is confirmed, Bob submits his own deposit with a higher gas fee, ensuring his transaction is mined first. 
4. As a result, Bob benefits from the price impact caused by his deposit, which is now followed by Alice's larger deposit.

## Impact
This could lead to a loss of funds for users if an attacker successfully front-runs their transactions, potentially resulting in less favorable asset prices for the original transaction initiator. 
The severity is medium because it requires specific conditions and the potential for loss is constrained by factors such as the size of the transaction and the attacker's willingness to pay higher gas fees.

## Code Snippet
these functions are used in `deposit` & `mint`, `withdraw`, so it must be address.

## Tool used

Manual Review

## Recommendation
- Implement a commit-reveal scheme where users first commit a hash of their intended action and then reveal the actual action after the commitment phase is over. This protects against front-running and provides a fairer process.
