# maxDeposit is in breach of EIP4626 Standard and invalidate check in deposit function

## Summary

In the `SyncSynthVault` contract, the `maxDeposit` function returns `type(uint256).max`, which is a clear-cut breach of the EIP4626 Standard since this is vastly higher than the actual maximum that would be accepted and will cause a revert.  

This also partially invalidates the `maxDeposit` check in the `deposit` function. 

## Vulnerability Detail

From the [EIP4626](https://eips.ethereum.org/EIPS/eip-4626#methods) Standard: 

```solidity
For maxDeposit:
MUST return the maximum amount of assets deposit would allow to be deposited for receiver and not cause a revert, 
which MUST NOT be higher than the actual maximum that would be accepted (it should underestimate if necessary).   
This assumes that the user has infinite assets, i.e. MUST NOT rely on balanceOf of asset.

```
Given that a user has infinite assets, the functions should return a value that MUST be accepted. Yet, we can see from the function code below, it returns `type(uint256).max`, a value which can easily exceed the theoretical total supply of the planned vaults by a factor of magnitude.

For example, the protocol plans to deploy a vault with [wBTC](https://www.coingecko.com/en/coins/wrapped-bitcoin). Since the maximum theoretical supply of wrapped BTC cannot be higher then the supply of [BTC](https://www.coingecko.com/en/coins/bitcoin), the absolute limit, even with infinite assets, is **21,000,000**.   

As such, the value returned will always cause a revert, which is a clear violation of the EIP4626 Standard. 

```solidity
    function maxDeposit(address) public view returns (uint256) {
        return vaultIsOpen && !paused() ? type(uint256).max : 0;
    }

    function deposit(
        uint256 assets,
        address receiver
    )
        public
        whenNotPaused
        returns (uint256)
    {
        uint256 maxAssets = maxDeposit(receiver);
        if (assets > maxAssets) {
            revert ERC4626ExceededMaxDeposit(receiver, assets, maxAssets);
        }

        uint256 sharesAmount = previewDeposit(assets);
        _deposit(_msgSender(), receiver, assets, sharesAmount);

        return sharesAmount;
    }
```
## Impact

1. Breach of EIP4626 Standard
2. The `maxDeposit` in the `deposit` function is ineffective since it will allow values that are impossible. In it's current state it only checks against deposits while the protocol is paused or the vault is closed.

## Recommendation

Change the function so that it will return the max supply the vault asset.
