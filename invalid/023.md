# The `depositWithPermit` function is allowed to be called by the permit creator only

## Summary
Function `depositWithPermit` is allowed to be called by the permit creator only. Not any other contracts will be able to execute these function on behalf of signer.

## Vulnerability Detail
The `depositWithPermit` function is allowed to provide a signed permit in order to receive, approve and deposit funds into the vault.

```javascript
function depositWithPermit(
        uint256 assets,
        address receiver,
        PermitParams calldata permitParams
    )
        external
        returns (uint256)
    {
        if (_asset.allowance(msg.sender, address(this)) < assets) {
            execPermit(_msgSender(), address(this), permitParams);
        }
        return deposit(assets, receiver);
    }
```
This function calls `exePermit` and pass `msg.sender` as `_owner` to that function.

```javascript
function execPermit(
        address owner,
        address spender,
        PermitParams calldata permitParams
    )
        internal
    {
        ERC20Permit(address(_asset)).permit(
            owner,
            spender,
            permitParams.value,
            permitParams.deadline,
            permitParams.v,
            permitParams.r,
            permitParams.s
        );
    }
```

This means, that the signer can be only the same person that called `depositWithPermit` function.

However, the purpose of the permit is to allow someone to sign the approve signature, so that this signature can be used by another contract to call some function on behalf of signer.

In this case, anyone should be able to sign permit for the vault, and vault should check that `receiver` is same who signed permit.

## Tool used

Manual Review

## Recommendation
Use `receiver` instead of `msg.sender`.

```javascript
function depositWithPermit(
        uint256 assets,
        address receiver,
        PermitParams calldata permitParams
    )
        external
        returns (uint256)
    {
        if (_asset.allowance(receiver, address(this)) < assets) {
            execPermit(receiver, address(this), permitParams);
        }
        return deposit(assets, receiver);
    }
```
