# `ERC7540Receiver.onERC7540RedeemReceived` and `ERC7540Receiver.onERC7540DepositReceived` does not Follow EIP7540 specification

## Summary
The implementation of `onERC7540RedeemReceived` and  `onERC7540DepositReceived` does not follow the EIP7540 standard which states the function takes in 5 parameters which are; `operator's address` ,`owner's address`,` requestID`,`asset` and `data` however only four parameters where passed in the `ERC7540Receiver.onERC7540RedeemReceived` and `ERC7540Receiver.onERC7540DepositReceived` omitting the `assets` parameter which is a non-compliance to the EIP7540 standard

The above photo is the implementation according to the EIP7540 as stated in the documentation here https://eips.ethereum.org/EIPS/eip-7540. This would mean the function selector will be different coz altering any parameter within a function declaration, even if the other parameters remain unchanged, leads to a different function signature.
A change in the function selector will affect interoperability with other smart-contact that expects implementation of the EIP7540 standard.

## Impact
This could lead to interoperability issues with other contracts expecting the standard's adherence.

Follow EIP7540 standards
```solidity

interface ERC7540Receiver {
    function onERC7540DepositReceived(
        address operator,
        address owner,
        uint256 requestId,
 +     uint256 assets,
        bytes memory data
    )
        external
        returns (bytes4);

    function onERC7540RedeemReceived(
