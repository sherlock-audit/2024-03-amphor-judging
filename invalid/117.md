# Incorrect Interface used in the `AsyncVault::_createRedeemRequest` function thus leading to failure of an expected value upon execution of the callback

## Summary

The audit was conducted to review the `ERC7540Receiver` interface implementation within the asyncSynthVault contract. The interface defined the `onERC7540RedeemReceived` which is expected to have five input parameters according to the EIP-7540 standard. However upon inspection, it was found that the `onERC7540RedeemReceived` function within the  `AsyncVault::_createRedeemRequest` function, is missing one input parameter potentially causing issues with compliance and functionality.

## Vulnerability Detail

1. Missing Input Param in `onERC7540RedeemReceived` function:

Description: Similarly, the onERC7540RedeemReceived function within the `AsyncVault::_createRedeemRequest` function is missing the shares input field, also required by the ERC7540 standard.

## Impact

The absence of these input parameter in the `onERC7540RedeemReceived` function can have the following impact:

1. Failure to return the expected value (0x01a2e97e) for the `onERC7540RedeemReceived`  function upon successful execution of the callback according to the docs [https://eips.ethereum.org/EIPS/eip-7540](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-03-amphor-Owenzo7/issues/EIP-7540).

## Code Snippet

In the `ERC7540Receiver` interface in `ERC7540Receiver.sol`

```javascript
function onERC7540RedeemReceived(
        address operator,
        address owner,
        uint256 requestId,
        // Missing input field --> uint256 shares
        bytes memory data
    )
        external
        returns (bytes4);
 ```
    
 The interface being used in the `AsyncVault::_createRedeemRequest` function

```javascript

function _createRedeemRequest(
        uint256 shares,
        address receiver,
        address owner,
        bytes memory data
    )
        internal
    {
        epochs[epochId].redeemRequestBalance[receiver] += shares;
        lastRedeemRequestId[owner] = epochId;

        if (
            data.length > 0
@>               && ERC7540Receiver(receiver).onERC7540RedeemReceived(
                    _msgSender(), owner, epochId, data
                ) != ERC7540Receiver.onERC7540RedeemReceived.selector
        ) revert ReceiverFailed();

   
        emit RedeemRequest(receiver, owner, epochId, _msgSender(), shares);
    }
```

## Tool used

Manual Review

## Recommendation

1. Interface Update.

Amend the ERC7540Receiver interface to include the missing input Param (shares) for the `onERC7540RedeemReceived` function.

Ensure compliance with the ERC7540 standard by updating the interface as follows:

In the `ERC7540Receiver` interface in `ERC7540Receiver.sol` for the `onERC7540RedeemReceived`  function add the shares param.

```diff
function onERC7540RedeemReceived(
        address operator,
        address owner,
        uint256 requestId,
+      uint256 shares
        bytes memory data
    )
        external
        returns (bytes4);
```

2. Code Adjustment.

Update the `AsyncVault::_createRedeemRequest` function to reflect the changes in the `ERC7540Receiver` interface.

```diff

function _createRedeemRequest(
        uint256 shares,
        address receiver,
        address owner,
        bytes memory data
    )
        internal
    {
        epochs[epochId].redeemRequestBalance[receiver] += shares;
        lastRedeemRequestId[owner] = epochId;

        if (
-            data.length > 0
-                && ERC7540Receiver(receiver).onERC7540RedeemReceived(
-                    _msgSender(), owner, epochId, data
+            data.length > 0
+             && ERC7540Receiver(receiver).onERC7540RedeemReceived(
+                 _msgSender(), owner, epochId, shares, data
                ) != ERC7540Receiver.onERC7540RedeemReceived.selector
        ) revert ReceiverFailed();

      
        emit RedeemRequest(receiver, owner, epochId, _msgSender(), shares);
    }

```

And then finally verify that the function now return the expected value `(0x01a2e97e)` for the `onERC7540RedeemReceived ` function upon successful execution of the callback according to the docs [https://eips.ethereum.org/EIPS/eip-7540](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-03-amphor-Owenzo7/issues/EIP-7540).
