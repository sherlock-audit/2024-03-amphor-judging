# Medium- Using _msgSender() & msg.sender interchangeably in `SyncSynthVault::depositWithPermit()`

## Summary

implementing custom logic in `_msgSender()` to permit meta-transactions in future upgrades could lead to unexpected consequences because `_msgSender()` and `msg.sender` would represent different addresses

## Vulnerability Detail

The code is using OpenZeppelin's `Context` contract extensively which is intended to allow meta-transactions. It works by using doing a call to `_msgSender()` instead of querying msg.sender directly, because the method allows those special transactions. The problem is that `SyncSynthVault::depositWithPermit()` use msg.sender directly instead of _msgSender() to assert if it has sufficient allowance on senders assets, which breaks this intent and might lead to unintended consequences.

## Impact

Low,the contract doesn't include support a trusted-forwarder/Meta-transaction yet

change `msg.sender` to `_msgSender()`
