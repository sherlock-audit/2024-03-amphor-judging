# Vaults are not boostrapped atomically

## Summary

## Vulnerability Detail
The protocol team mentioned that vaults will be bootstrapped with initial liquidity to prevent inflation attacks. To effectively prevent an inflation attack the funds should be deposited in the vault atomically during [initialization](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-03-amphor/blob/main/asynchronous-vault/src/AsyncSynthVault.sol#L181), but this doesn't happen, opening up the possibility of an inflation attack on the bootstrapping transaction itself.

## Impact
The protocol team could fall victim to an inflation attack on their first deposit.

## Recommendation
Make the first deposit in the vault during the [initialization](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-03-amphor/blob/main/asynchronous-vault/src/AsyncSynthVault.sol#L181) call, this way the first deposit can't be front-run.
