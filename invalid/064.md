# Inability to Reduce Redeem and Deposit Requests when `owner` and `receiver` address are different

## Summary
The function `decreaseRedeemRequest` and ` decreaseDepositRequest ` designed to allow owner who made a `requestredeem` and `requestdeposit` to decrease request amount will not work when the address of owner is different from receiver (i.e when owner wants to another address to claim request).

## Vulnerability Detail
To understand this bug lets do a walk through of what happens when one calls a `requestredeem`  or `requestdeposit`  function.
```solidity
function requestDeposit(
        uint256 assets,
        address receiver,
        address owner,
        bytes memory data
    )
        public
        whenNotPaused
        whenClosed
    {
        // vault
        if (_msgSender() != owner) {
            revert ERC7540CantRequestDepositOnBehalfOf();
        }
        if (previewClaimDeposit(receiver) > 0) {
            revert MustClaimFirst(receiver);
        }

        if (assets > maxDepositRequest(owner)) {
            revert ExceededMaxDepositRequest(
                receiver, assets, maxDepositRequest(owner)
            );
        }

        _asset.safeTransferFrom(owner, address(pendingSilo), assets);

        _createDepositRequest(assets, receiver, owner, data);
    }
```
A series of logics is implemented then the function  `_createDepositRequest(assets, receiver, owner, data)` is called
```solidity

function _createDepositRequest(
        uint256 assets,
        address receiver,
        address owner,
        bytes memory data
    )
        internal
    {
    >>    epochs[epochId].depositRequestBalance[receiver] += assets;
        if (lastDepositRequestId[receiver] != epochId) {
            lastDepositRequestId[receiver] = epochId;
        }

        if (
            data.length > 0
                && ERC7540Receiver(receiver).onERC7540DepositReceived(
                    _msgSender(), owner, epochId, data
                ) != ERC7540Receiver.onERC7540DepositReceived.selector
        ) revert ReceiverFailed();

        emit DepositRequest(receiver, owner, epochId, _msgSender(), assets);
    }
```
Here  `[epochId].depositRequestBalance[receiver] += assets;` It uses the current epoch ID and also the current address of the receiver to store the depositRequestBalance 

And here `lastDepositRequestId[receiver] = epochId;` stores the epochID using the receiver address in mapping lastDepositRequestId

Howevers in the function `decreaseDepositRequest ` the address of owner is used to retrieve depositRequestBalance  as shown below.
```solidity

/*
    This function is used to decrease the amount of assets requested to deposit
    by the
        user. It can only be called by the user who made the request.
    */
function decreaseDepositRequest(uint256 assets)
        external
        whenClosed
        whenNotPaused
    {
        address owner = _msgSender();
>>   uint256 oldBalance = epochs[epochId].depositRequestBalance[owner];
        epochs[epochId].depositRequestBalance[owner] -= assets;
        _asset.safeTransferFrom(address(pendingSilo), owner, assets);
        emit DecreaseDepositRequest(
            epochId,
            owner,
            oldBalance,
            epochs[epochId].depositRequestBalance[owner]
        );
    }
```
As stated in the comment  the function can only be called by the user who made the request. Thus `msg.sender` is the owner.
the attempt to retrieve requestdepositbalance here `uint256 oldBalance = epochs[epochId].depositRequestBalance[owner]` will return an in valid number 0 as the balance initially was stored using the receiver's address which in this edge case is different from the owner.
thus making it impossible to decrease deposit request.
Similar discrepancies apply with the `requestredeem` and the `decreaseredeemrequest`.

## Impact
User unable to decrease deposit request and redeem request in edge case

## Tool used

Manual Review

## Recommendation
Use same address to set and retrieve depositRequestBalance and depositredeemBalance in mapping.
