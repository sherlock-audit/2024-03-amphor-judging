# `SyncSynthVault` contract is missing storage gaps.

## Summary
`SyncSynthVault` contract is not having storage gaps which can cause storage collision.

## Vulnerability Detail
The `SyncSynthVault` contract is a abstract contract that are meant to be inherited from `AsyncSynthVault` contract. Moreover, it implement a custom initialization mechanism, it is important to note that if this contracts are meant to be used by upgradeable contracts storage gaps should be added to the contract itself, to prevent storage collisions in the case of upgrading the implementation.

## Impact
Missing storage gaps which can cause storage collision

## Recommendation
Add storage gaps to the abstract contract.
