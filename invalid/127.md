# The deposit function does not check for the `maxMint` amount

## Summary
The deposit function does not check for the `maxMint` amount

## Vulnerability Detail
The `deposit` function has a check for `maxDeposit` and reverts if the deposit value is more than max(uint256). But, it does not check the shares to be less than `maxMint` amount and hence bypasses this check.

The `deposit` function is calling `previewDeposit` function which convert the assets into shares 
by `_convertToShares` function.

However, in the `_convertToShares` function the calculation  utilizes the mulDiv operation with parameters `totalSupply() + 1` and `totalAssets() + 1`.If the `totalSupply` is a very large number, the multiplication step might result in a very large number. This could potentially exceed the maximum number of shares that can be minted (maxMint).

## Recommendation
include the `maxMint` check in the deposit function to prevent this problem.
