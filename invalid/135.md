# Front-Running Vulnerability in ERC20 Permit Function of `VaultZapper`, `AsyncSynthVault`, and `SyncSynthVault` Contracts

## Summary
The `VaultZapper`, `AsyncSynthVault`, and `SyncSynthVault` contracts are all susceptible to front-running attacks on their ERC20 `permit` function implementations, potentially leading to the failure of legitimate user transactions and gas-griefing.

## Vulnerability Detail
The `VaultZapper` contract's functions `zapAndDepositWithPermit()`, `zapAndRequestDepositWithPermit()`, and `zapAndClaimAndRequestDepositWithPermit()`, the `AsyncSynthVault` contract's `claimAndRequestDepositWithPermit` method, and the `SyncSynthVault` contract's `depositWithPermit` function utilize the `permit` function to approve token allowances with off-chain signatures. Transactions involving `permit` can be spotted and front-run by attackers in the mempool, who can use higher gas fees to change the nonce or allowance state before the original transaction is processed.

## Impact
Front-running attacks on permit transactions can lead to failed user transactions, resulting in not only the loss of gas but also potential gas griefing, where attackers deliberately cause victims to waste gas on transactions that are doomed to fail. This can disrupt intended actions and lead to financial losses for users.

## Code Snippet
The vulnerability is present in the `execPermit` function of the `SyncSynthVault` contract and  the `_executePermit` function of the `VaultZapper` contract.

```solidity
// SyncSynthVault contract snippet
function execPermit(
    address owner,
    address spender,
    PermitParams calldata permitParams
)
    internal
{
    ERC20Permit(address(_asset)).permit(
        owner,
        spender,
        permitParams.value,
        permitParams.deadline,
        permitParams.v,
        permitParams.r,
        permitParams.s
    );
}
```

```solidity
// VaultZapper contract snippet
function _executePermit(
    IERC20 token,
    address owner,
    address spender,
    PermitParams calldata permitParams
)
    internal
{
    ERC20Permit(address(token)).permit(
        owner,
        spender,
        permitParams.value,
        permitParams.deadline,
        permitParams.v,
        permitParams.r,
        permitParams.s
    );
}

## Tool used

Manual Review

## Recommendation
To mitigate this issue, implement a try/catch block around the permit call to handle potential reverts due to front-running. Additionally, after a failed permit, check if the allowance is already sufficient before reverting.

### Sample

```diff
// Suggested fix for the VaultZapper contract
function _executePermit(
    IERC20 token,
    address owner,
    address spender,
    PermitParams calldata permitParams
)
    internal
{
+   try ERC20Permit(address(token)).permit(
        owner,
        spender,
        permitParams.value,
        permitParams.deadline,
        permitParams.v,
        permitParams.r,
        permitParams.s
-   );
+   ) {
+       // Permit succeeded, nothing more to do
+       return;
+   } catch {
+       // Permit failed, possibly due to front-running
+       if (token.allowance(owner, spender) >= permitParams.value) {
+           // Allowance is already set to the desired value or higher
+           return;
+       }
+       // If the permit failed and the allowance is insufficient, revert
+       revert("Permit failure");
+   }
}
```
