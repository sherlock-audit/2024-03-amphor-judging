# Allowance check with the caller address instead of the contract address causes _zapIn() functionality to break for some tokens

## Summary
Allowance check with the caller address instead of the contract address causes _zapIn() functionality to break for some tokens

## Vulnerability Detail
When the _zapIn() is called to execute the zap before request a deposit, right before executing the zap on the router it calls `_transferTokenInAndApprove` to transfer the token to the vaultZapper contract, and then the vaultZapper contract approves the router before calling executeZap:
```solidity
 function _transferTokenInAndApprove(
        address router,
        IERC20 tokenIn,
        uint256 amount
    )
        internal
    {
        tokenIn.safeTransferFrom(_msgSender(), address(this), amount);
@>      if (tokenIn.allowance(_msgSender(), router) < amount) {
            tokenIn.forceApprove(router, amount);
        } 
    }
```
From the above, you'll notice that instead of using `address(this)` in checking the allowance the router has of the contract, it checks  _msgSender() although the amount is already transferred to the contract. This will cause executeZap to fail when tokens that don't have allowance from the contract are needed to be swapped, therefore causing _zapIn() and all zapping operation for that token to fail since _zapIn() is called in all zap functions.

## Impact
executeZap will fail when tokens that don't have allowance from the contract are needed to be swapped, therefore causing _zapIn() and all zapping operation for that token to fail

Manual Review

## Recommendation
Here is the fix:
```solidity
 function _transferTokenInAndApprove(
        address router,
        IERC20 tokenIn,
        uint256 amount
    )
        internal
    {
        tokenIn.safeTransferFrom(_msgSender(), address(this), amount);
+       if (tokenIn.allowance(address(this), router) < amount) {
-       if (tokenIn.allowance(_msgSender(), router) < amount) {
            tokenIn.forceApprove(router, amount);
        } 
    }
```
