# VaultZapper owner can steal all tokens that approved VaultZapper

## Summary

VaultZapper owner can still all tokens are approved VaultZapper

## Vulnerability Detail

In [_executeZap](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-03-amphor/blob/main/asynchronous-vault/src/VaultZapper.sol#L359) function we can call any arbitrary target that owner allowed. This is a problem because if a malicious Owner would allow targeting some token (let's say weth), then that owner could call `weth.transferFrom(victim, attacker, amount)`, basically stealing all of the approved tokens. Users often tend to approve uintmax, so they can save on gas, so anybody who would approve VaultZapper (the team confirmed VaultZapper would be the contract that users interact with from the front end) would be vulnerable to this attack. I know that we have the assumption that the owner of the protocol is trusted, but this is more than trusting the owner as he can steal the money that was not transferred to the protocol and sits in the user's wallet. That is clearly too much power for the VaultZapper owner.

## Impact

All tokens that approved VaultZapper stolen

## Code Snippet

```solidity
 function _executeZap(
        address target,
        bytes memory data
    )
        internal
        returns (bytes memory response)
    {
        (bool success, bytes memory _data) =
            target.call{ value: msg.value }(data);
        if (!success) {
            if (data.length > 0) revert SwapFailed(string(_data));
            else revert SwapFailed("Unknown reason");
        }
        return _data;
    }
 ```

## Tool used

Manual Review

## Recommendation

1. As the absolute must-have, I would recommend checking the 4 bytes of `data` (so basically function selector) 
inside `(bool success, bytes memory _data) = target.call{ value: msg.value }(data);`, and comparing it with `transferFrom` selector (`0x23b872dd`), if they are the same then the function should revert. That won't cover all of the cases as different tokens might have some other mechanism to transfer tokens, but it should decrease significantly the surface of the attack.
2. I would consider using timelock for the added allowed router, for example, 3 days, so users have time to react, and revoke approval if some suspicious router is added. Removing the allowed router shouldn't be time-locked.
3. This point is not directly to the described vulnerability but to the described in the issue part of the code. I would consider adding allowed router => allowed selectors mapping, so all of the callable selectors for the route must be added by the owner. Whitelisting selectors limits the potential attack surface, and would protect against calling some unexpected action by attackers on the router, that could be potentially dangerous for the users.
