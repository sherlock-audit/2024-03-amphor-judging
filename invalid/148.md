# The settle function sends the excess assets to the owner but still mints the excess share to the claimableSilo causing shares imbalance

## Summary
The settle function sends the excess assets to the owner but still mints the excess share to the claimableSilo causing shares imbalance

## Vulnerability Detail
If there are more assets in the pendingSilo contract than the shares (converted to asset) in the pendingSilo contract, it sends the excess assets to the owner without depositing it into the claimableSilo contract. In the case of the reverse, the owner deposits the lacking asset to the claimableSilo contract. This is to ensure they are balanced. However, in the midst of all this, the shares equivalence is ignored meaning It still mints the share equivalent of that excess asset that was not deposited into the claimableSilo contract which is the `sharesToMint` to the claimableSilo contract, causing shares imbalance:
```solidity
 _mint(address(claimableSilo), settleValues.sharesToMint);
 ```

## Impact
It ends up minting the share equivalent of that excess asset that was not deposited into the claimableSilo contract, causing shares imbalance:

Manual Review

## Recommendation
Since in the case of the assets in the pendingSilo contract being more than the shares worth of asset in the pendingSilo contract it sends the excess assets to the owner without depositing it into the claimableSilo contract to mint just the shares worth of asset in the pendingSilo contract. In the case of the reverse, the owner deposit the lacking asset to the claimableSilo contract to be able to mint the shares worth of asset in the pendingSilo contract. This means in both cases just the shares worth of asset in the pendingSilo contract should be minted which is the `pendingRedeem`.

Here is the recommended fix:
```solidity
  _burn(address(pendingSilo), settleValues.pendingRedeem);
+ _mint(address(claimableSilo), settleValues.pendingRedeem);
- _mint(address(claimableSilo), settleValues.sharesToMint);
```
