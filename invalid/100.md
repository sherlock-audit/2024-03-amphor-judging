# Any user can burn their own shares

## Summary
`Shares` are an ERC20 token that a user receives when depositing the underlying asset into the `AsyncSynthVault` smart contract. These shares are not burnable by design, but there is a possibility to burn them.
## Vulnerability Detail
To obtain shares when interacting with the `AsyncSynthVault` smart contract, the following actions need to be taken:

1)The user calls the `requestDeposit` function and deposits the underlying asset.
2)The owner calls the `settle` function.
3)The user calls the `claimDeposit` function and receives the shares.


The issue lies in the fact that when calling the `claimDeposit` function, the user can specify any address to receive the shares. Since the `_update()` internal function from `OpenZeppelin` is used inside the function, all checks for the zero address are skipped. This allows the user to specify the zero address as the receiver of shares, effectively burning them.
```solidity
function claimDeposit(address receiver)
        public
        whenNotPaused
        returns (uint256 shares)
    {
        return _claimDeposit(_msgSender(), receiver);
    }
    
    
    
function _claimDeposit(
        address owner,
        address receiver
    )
        internal
        returns (uint256 shares)
    {
        shares = previewClaimDeposit(owner);

        uint256 lastRequestId = lastDepositRequestId[owner];
        uint256 assets = epochs[lastRequestId].depositRequestBalance[owner];
        epochs[lastRequestId].depositRequestBalance[owner] = 0;
-->     _update(address(claimableSilo), receiver, shares);
        emit ClaimDeposit(lastRequestId, owner, receiver, assets, shares);
    }    
```

## Impact
Users can burn their shares, which can lead to unexpected behaviors such as an increase in the value of shares.

## Recommendation

Consider adding a check for the zero address in the `claimDeposit` function.
