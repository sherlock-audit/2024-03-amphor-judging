# claimDeposit function can lead to loss of pending deposit amount

## Summary
If a user has a pending deposit request and calls the `claimDeposit` function in the same epoch that he has created the request the pending deposit amount would be lost, the malicious user can abuse this vulnerability and call claimAndRequestDeposit by deposing a very small amount on behalf of other users and leading to loss of their assets. 
## Vulnerability Detail
users can create a deposit request by `requestDeposit` which adds the deposit amount to depositRequestBalance of user and updates lastRequestDepositId for user ( every deposit request that has been created in a single epoch has the same requestId )

user calls claimDeposit in the same epoch ( deposit request is not being processed ), `_claimDeposit` would calculate claimable shares, since request is not being processed so no shares would be minted.

Now depositRequestBalance of user would be resetted without any shares being minted

Malicious user can abuse this vulnerability by calling claimAndRequestDeposit on behalf of other users by deposing a very small amount and causing loss of pending deposit of victims.

## Impact
Permanent freezing of funds for victims ( loss of pending deposit amount )

## Tool used

Manual Review

## Recommendation
In `_claimRedeem` if  `epochs[lastRequestId].redeemRequestBalance[owner] > 0` revert the transaction.
