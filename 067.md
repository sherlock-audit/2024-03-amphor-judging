# The owner can set `_maxDrawdown` at anytime, even when the vault is closed.

## Summary

The owner can call `SyncSynthVault.setMaxDrawdown()` at anytime to reset the `_maxDrawdown`.

## Vulnerability Detail

https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-03-amphor/blob/main/asynchronous-vault/src/SyncSynthVault.sol#L251-L254

```javascript
    function setMaxDrawdown(uint16 newMaxDrawdown) external onlyOwner {
        if (newMaxDrawdown > 10_000) revert MaxDrawdownReached();
        _maxDrawdown = newMaxDrawdown;
    }
```

Users depend on the value of `_maxDrawdown` when the vault is open, as it impacts the return of assets when the vault is reopened. When the vault is closed, users lose control over their deposited assets. Therefore, resetting `_maxDrawdown` when the vault is closed is unfair to the users.

## Impact

The owner can reset `_maxDrawdown` when the vault is closed, allowing them to return a lesser amount of assets. This could negatively impact the credibility of the protocol.

## Tool used

Manual Review

## Recommendation

`SyncSynthVault.setMaxDrawdown()` should only be implemented when the vault is open.

```diff
    function setMaxDrawdown(uint16 newMaxDrawdown) external onlyOwner {
+       if (!vaultIsOpen) revert VaultIsClosed();
        if (newMaxDrawdown > 10_000) revert MaxDrawdownReached();
        _maxDrawdown = newMaxDrawdown;
    }
```
