# The function `ClaimRedeemAndZap` not defined or declared `VaultZapper` contract

## Summary
There is no function  ClaimRedeemAndZap in the provided VaultZapper contract code. However, there is an event named ClaimRedeemAndZap which no other function in the contract emits to which suggests  that the contract is expected to handle a process that involves claiming, redeeming, and zapping in some context, but the actual function that would emit this event is not included in the contract.

## Vulnerability Detail
```solidity
  event ClaimRedeemAndZap(
        IERC7540 indexed vault,
        address indexed router,
        uint256 shares,
        uint256 assets
    );
    event RouterApproved(address indexed router, IERC20 indexed token);
    event RouterAuthorized(address indexed router, bool allowed);
    event VaultAuthorized(IERC4626 indexed vault, bool allowed);
```
Event expected to receive emit from function that involves claiming, redeeming, and zapping in the contract but non as such was declared

## Impact
Users won't have the option to claim redeem and zap
