## Summary
Users lose their entire investment when making a deposit and resulting shares are zero

## Impact
Users could receive 0 shares and thus lose their entire investment when making a deposit.

When a malicious user make the first deposit to this vault .

1. he deposit 1 wei asset , get 1 * 1 / 1 = 1 shares .
2. he firstly transfer a lot asset (for example: 1e18) to this contract firstly , and then deposit a small amount (1 wei) to this contract, now he will get ( 1 * 2 / (2+1e18) ) , and rounding method is `floor` , he will get 0 shares . 
3. thirdly , now his one share is value 1 ether, the proportion of asset to shares will be attacked .


## Code Snippet
```solidity
function previewDeposit(uint256 assets) public view returns (uint256) {
        return _convertToShares(assets, Math.Rounding.Floor);
    }
```

```solidity
   function _convertToShares(
        uint256 assets,
        Math.Rounding rounding
    )
        internal
        view
        returns (uint256)
    {
        return assets.mulDiv(totalSupply() + 1, totalAssets() + 1, rounding);
    }
```


## Tool used

Manual Review

## Recommendation
1. deposit as more as possible asset to this vault when this valut contract is deployed .
2. add zero check before `_mint` shares .
