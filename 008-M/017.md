# DepositPermit functions can lead to loss of user funds

## Summary
The vault implements Depositwithpermit functions  however, the vaultâ€™s underlying asset is intended to be Weth , usdc and u expect to interact with the following assets - weth, usdc, usdt, wbtc .
in the case of  WETH does not. Surprisingly, when permit is called on WETH, the function call will execute without any errors.

This is because the fallback inside WETH is execute when permit is called.
 
## Vulnerability Detail - 
Alice gives infinite approval  to spend WETH
Alice calls depositwithPermit and etc , deposits 1 WETH into the Vault
Attacker calls depositWithPermit, passes an empty signature and transfers all tokens from Alice into the vault , crediting the attacker for the deposit.
Attacker withdraws all tokens credited to him.
