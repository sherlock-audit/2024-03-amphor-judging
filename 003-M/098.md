# Calling `claimDeposit` after `requestDeposit` in the current epoch will lead the user to lose access to their deposits.

## Summary

Calling `claimDeposit` after `requestDeposit` in the current epoch will lead the user to lose access to their deposits.

## Vulnerability Detail

`AsyncSynthVault` uses `depositRequestBalance` to keep track of the deposit requests when the vault is closed, and after settling and the epoch is incremented, users can claim shares for their deposit, but in the case when `isCurrentEpoch` is true `previewClaimDeposit` returns 0, and the depositRequestBalance is set to 0 `epochs[lastRequestId].depositRequestBalance[owner] = 0;` and the receiver the does not receive any vault share.

## Impact

Depositors will lose their funds and cannot claim them in the future if they claim in the current epoch.

## Recommendation

Don't allow users to claim vault shares when the current `lastDepositRequestId[owner]` is equal to the current `epochId`.
