# Protocol is not prepared for fee on transfer that could be turned on `USDT`

## Summary

The protocol is not prepared for a fee on transfer that could be turned on `USDT`

## Vulnerability Detail

Protocol wrote in the form that it doesn't support fees on transfer tokens, but this is only partially true because tokens like [USDT](https://etherscan.io/token/0xdac17f958d2ee523a2206206994597c13d831ec7#code), which is one of the mentioned by team underlying token has fee mechanism in it, it is just not turned on now. When the fee on transfer is turned on it would have various implications, just to name a few:
* Silos contracts would stop working for the last user that would like to claim, due to there will be not enough assets to transfer. The team would have to transfer manually additional USDT in order for it to work
* [deposit](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-03-amphor/blob/main/asynchronous-vault/src/SyncSynthVault.sol#L300) would mint more shares than it should for the actual amount that was transferred into the vault 
* every time on _settle function lastSavedBalance would send assets to the owner it would account for more than it really sent him, so that would be decreased from the performance fee

## Impact

Various miscalculations across the protocol

Manual Review

## Recommendation

1. Either prepare a protocol for handling fee on transfer tokens
2. Or prepare plan B what to do when USDT turns on its fee on transfer, and have it documented
