# Flawed Balance Calculation in _zapIn Function Hinders Non-Native Token Transfers

## Summary

The `VaultZapper::_zapIn()` function will not work as expected for non-native token transfers.

## Vulnerability Detail

[The following check](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-03-amphor/blob/main/asynchronous-vault/src/VaultZapper.sol#L150-L157) in the `_zapIn()` function always will revert for non-native token transfers due to incorrect expected balance calculations. While for native token transfers the contract correctly subtract `msg.value` from the contract's current balance, the same is not done for other tokens. Instead, when `zapIn` is invoked for non-native tokens, it simply transfers tokens from `msg.sender` to the contract using the [`_transferTokenInAndApprove()`](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-03-amphor/blob/main/asynchronous-vault/src/VaultZapper.sol#L160-L171) function. Consequently, `balanceAfterZap` always exceeds `expectedBalance` as we calculate it in the following way 
```solidity
uint256 balanceAfterZap = msg.value == 0
            ? tokenIn.balanceOf(address(this))
            : address(this).balance;
```
And this will cause the function always to fail for non-native token transfers.

## Impact

Users are unable to use the `zapAndDeposit`, `zapAndRequestDeposit`, and `zapAndClaimAndRequestDeposit` functions for non-native tokens.

## Tool used

Manual Review

## Recommendation

To resolve this issue, adjust the expected balance calculation for non-native tokens as follows: `expectedBalance = tokenIn.balanceOf(address(this)) - amount;`, similar to the approach used for native tokens.
