# In `AsyncSynthVault::settle`,  event `EpochStart ` has wrong parameter

## Summary
When the `EpochStart` event is emitted in the `AsyncSynthVault::settle` function, it logs wrong value. The `lastSavedBalance` value  in the second parameter position is always 0. But the `lastSavedBalance` in the protocol means the amount of assert that the owner owes the vault. That's not correct for always being 0.
## Vulnerability Detail
When the `EpochStart` event is emitted in the `AsyncSynthVault::settle` function, it logs wrong value. The `lastSavedBalance` value  in the second parameter position is always 0. But the `lastSavedBalance` in the protocol means the amount of assert that the owner owes the vault. That's not correct for always being 0.

## Impact
Event emission is incorrect, leading to off-chain functions potentially malfunctioning.

## Tool used
Manual Review

## Recommendation
```diff
 function settle(uint256 newSavedBalance) external {
        (uint256 lastSavedBalance, uint256 totalSupply) =
            _settle(newSavedBalance);
-        lastSavedBalance = 0;
        emit EpochStart(block.timestamp, lastSavedBalance, totalSupply);
    }
```
