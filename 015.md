# Compromised Owner and `whenNotPaused` Modifier Leading to Frozen Funds

## Summary

User funds may become inaccessible due to the compromise of the protocol owner and the implementation of the `whenNotPaused` modifier. The vulnerability affects various functions within the protocol, leading to users being unable to withdraw their funds, thereby causing their assets to become frozen.

## Vulnerability Detail

In the event that the protocol owner is compromised and the modifier `whenNotPaused` is implemented, users may find themselves unable to withdraw their funds, thus leading to their funds being stuck.

**Functions affected by this vulnerability:**

| Functions               | Description                                                    |
| ----------------------- | -------------------------------------------------------------- |
| \_claimRedeem()         | Users are unable to claim their deposited tokens               |
| \_settle()              | Tokens are neither minted nor burnt from/to the `pending/claimable` Silo |
| requestRedeem()         | Users cannot request a redeem                                   |
| decreaseRedeemRequest() | Users cannot decrease their Withdraws/Redeems                  |


## Impact

User funds become inaccessible, resulting in frozen assets without any means of withdrawal.

Moreover, incase of a compromised Owner the attacker can access functions like `withdrawToken` and `withdrawNativeToken` and drain the assets

## Recommendation

Consider adding a way for users to withdraw their assets if an owner is compromised.
