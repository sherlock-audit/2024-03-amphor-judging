# `AsyncSynthVault` contract is not following EIP7540 correctly.

## Summary
`AsyncSynthVault` contract letting user to preview the effects of their multiple actions when using async vault which is prohibited in EIP7540.

## Vulnerability Detail
As per EIP7540 states:-
All ERC-7540 asynchronous tokenized Vaults MUST implement ERC-4626 with overrides for certain behavior described below.
`previewDeposit` and `previewMint` MUST revert for all callers and inputs.
`previewRedeem` and `previewWithdraw` MUST revert for all callers and inputs.

## Impact
Not following EIP7540 which leads the user to call `previewRedeem`, `previewWithdraw`,`previewDeposit` and `previewMint` functions when the the vault is closed and the user can only use async vault.

## Tool used
Manual Review

## Recommendation

The recommendation is to add a `whenNotClosed()` modifier in `previewRedeem`, `previewWithdraw`,`previewDeposit` and `previewMint` functions which will let the user to call these functions only if the vault is open otherwise user can't call, this will make the async vault follow the EIP7540 correctly.
