# DAI permit not supported

## Summary

DAI permit not supported in the [_executePermit](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-03-amphor/blob/main/asynchronous-vault/src/VaultZapper.sol#L367C5-L384C6)

## Vulnerability Detail

DAI permit is not supported, because it handles permit differently https://github.com/d-xo/weird-erc20?tab=readme-ov-file#unusual-permit-function . Team has confirmed that users will use DAI to deposit to vaults via VaultZapper. As the team implemented permit functionality for all actions then they would like to use it on the front end to save gas. DAI token is a very popular token, and not being able to use its permit functionality would waste users' gas.

## Impact

Users not able to use `permit` with popular DAI, wasting gas for two transactions

## Code Snippet


```solidity
function _executePermit(
        IERC20 token,
        address owner,
        address spender,
        PermitParams calldata permitParams
    )
        internal
    {
        ERC20Permit(address(token)).permit(
            owner,
            spender,
            permitParams.value,
            permitParams.deadline,
            permitParams.v,
            permitParams.r,
            permitParams.s
        );
    }
 ```

## Tool used

Manual Review

## Recommendation

Create additional function for VaultZapper that would be able to handle DAI-way permit
