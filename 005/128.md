# `_executePermit()` called on DAI token in `VaultZapper.sol` could fail

## Summary
Since DAI could be used in the zapper but not as a vault underlying. The `_executePermit()` called on DAI token in `VaultZapper.sol` doesn't function as intended.

## Vulnerability Detail
Dai's permit unfortunatelly doesn't follow the ERC2612 standard that we implement in ERC20Permit. The functions take different parameters 8 parameters instead of 7, and the signature is built differently.

## Impact
The function won't get executed for DAI token and can cause other functions that are depended on it to fail. Functions like ` zapAndDepositWithPermit()`, `zapAndRequestDepositWithPermit()` and `zapAndClaimAndRequestDepositWithPermit()` are dependent on the execution of this function.

## Tool used
Manual Review

## Recommendation
Have a check if the `token` is DAI and correspondingly invoke it's Permit function if not go with the `ERC20Permit` function for rest of the tokens.
