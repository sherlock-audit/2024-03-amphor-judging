# Slippage controls for `SyncSynthVault::Mint()` and `SyncSynthVault::deposit()` functions are missing.

## Summary
Missing of slippage control in `SyncSynthVault::Mint()` and `SyncSynthVault::deposit()` functions can cause griefing attack to user.

## Vulnerability Detail
As per EIP4626 states "If implementors intend to support EOA account access directly, they should consider adding an additional function call for deposit/mint/withdraw/redeem with the means to accommodate slippage loss or unexpected deposit/withdrawal limits, since they have no other means to revert the transaction if the exact output amount is not achieved."

As the slippage is not defined will cost the the user to spent much more asset amount than expected if calls `mint` functions or will get much lesser asset amount than expected if calls the `deposit` function.

## Impact
The impact on user is that it will cost the user to spent much more asset amount or will get the much lesser asset amount than expected.

## Proof Of Concept
The concept and case for `SyncSynthVault::deposit()` functions is similar to this.

BOB wants to mint 1e18 shares tokens in exchange for sending  1e18 asset tokens.
Yet, such `SyncSynthVault::mint` function call causes 1.2e18 assets tokens to be transferred from BOB.
BOB unexpectedly sends 0.2e18 more asset tokens than expected for minting 1e18 shares tokens.

## Tool used
Manual Review

## Recommendation
The recommendation is to include a mechanism in deposit function that allows msg.sender to specify the minimum shares to be minted for calling the corresponding `SyncSynthVault:_deposit` function; calling such `deposit` function should revert if the corresponding `SyncSynthVault:_deposit` function's shares output is less than the specified minimum shares to be minted. Similarly, a mechanism should be include in `SyncSynthVault::mint` function that allows msg.sender to specify the maximum asset tokens to be sent for calling the corresponding  `SyncSynthVault:_deposit` function; calling such `SyncSynthVault::mint` function should revert if the function's assets output is more than the specified maximum asset tokens to be sent.
