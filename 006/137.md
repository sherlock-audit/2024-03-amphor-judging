# Medium- No storage gap in `SyncSynthVault`

## Summary

storage collisions when new variable is added to `SyncSynthVault` on upgrade
For upgradeable contracts, there must be storage gap to "allow developers to freely add new state variables in the future without compromising the storage compatibility with existing deployments". Otherwise it may be very difficult to write new implementation code. Without storage gap, the variable in child contract might be overwritten by the upgraded base contract if new variables are added to the base contract. This could have unintended and very serious consequences to the child contracts.

## Vulnerability Detail

As an example, the `AsyncSynthVault` contract inherits `SyncSynthVault`, and the `SyncSynthVault` contract does not contain any storage gap. If in a future upgrade, an additional variable is added to the `SyncSynthVault` contract, that new variable will overwrite the storage slot of the `epochId` variable in the `AsyncSynthVault` contract, causing unintended consequences.

## Impact

High, storage collision

## Tool used

Manual Review

## Recommendation

add a storage gap at the end of `SyncSynthVault` to be decreased when a new variable is added
```sol
contract SyncSynthVault {
  //...code...
  uint256 [50] private __gap;
}
```
