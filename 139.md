# `AsyncSynthVault.sol::_settle()` should send the pendingSilo to the `owner()` not to `claimableSilo` address

## Summary
Here we are simulating the actual deposit and redeem of the requests to analyze some key aspects: 
Are they more inflow(pendingDeposit) or outflow(assetsToWithdraw) from the vault ? 
And so if the owner must give back some assets to the vault (claimableSilo) or if the vault will give assets to the owner()

## Vulnerability Detail
From **`previewSettle()`**:  
```solidity
else if (pendingDeposit < assetsToWithdraw) {
      assetsToVault = assetsToWithdraw - pendingDeposit;
      //the above statement, ensures that sufficient assets are now to be transferred in the Vault, that can be withdrawn by the users.
 }
```
As inflow < outlflow, we need to push from `owner()` to `claimableSilo`, below line does that.
```solidity
  _asset.safeTransferFrom(
        owner(), address(claimableSilo), assetsToVault
            );
```
```solidity
if (settleValues.pendingDeposit > 0) {
                _asset.safeTransferFrom(
                    address(pendingSilo),
                    address(claimableSilo),
                    settleValues.pendingDeposit
                );
            }
//inflow>0, transfers the inflow to claimable, instead of transferring it to owner() of the vault.
```
## Impact

Inorder to farm with the funds, the pendingSilo transferred to the owner() can help in including more funds in the protocol's farming stategy to generate more yield and more profits for the users. Instead of sending the funds back to claimableSilo where the demand for `assetsToWithdrawn` has already been met, the funds over there doesn't yield comparatively.

## Recommendation
 Instead of sending the funds back to claimableSilo where the demand for `assetsToWithdrawn` has already been met, the funds over there doesn't yield comparatively.
 ```solidity
if (settleValues.pendingDeposit > 0) {
                _asset.safeTransferFrom(
                    address(pendingSilo),
                    owner(),
                    settleValues.pendingDeposit
                );
            }
```
