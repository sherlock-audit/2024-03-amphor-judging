# IERC20 transfer() returns a bool value that needs to be checked for successful transfer of tokens.

## Summary
The ERC20.transfer() and ERC20.transferFrom() functions return a boolean value indicating success. This parameter needs to be checked for success. Some tokens do not revert if the transfer failed but return false instead.

## Vulnerability Detail
The return value of `.transfer()` on any ERC20 token needs to be checked to know if the `transfer` was successful and there were no silent failures.

## Impact
Tokens that don't actually perform the transfer and return false are still counted as a correct transfer. Furthermore, tokens that do not correctly implement the EIP20 standard, like USDT which does not return a success boolean, will revert.

## Recommendation
We recommend using [OpenZeppelinâ€™s SafeERC20](https://github.com/OpenZeppelin/openzeppelin-contracts/blob/release-v4.1/contracts/token/ERC20/utils/SafeERC20.sol#L74) versions with the safeTransfer and safeTransferFrom functions that handle the return value check as well as non-standard-compliant tokens.
