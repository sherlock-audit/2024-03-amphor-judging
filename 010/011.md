# Vault proxy contract could be initialized

## Summary
In the contracts implementing Openzeppelinâ€™s upgradable contract, the uninitialized implementation contracts can be taken over by an attacker with the initialize function. 

## Vulnerability Detail
This seems to have been the intended case, but the ``_disableInitializers()`` call has been commented out in both of the constructors of the vault contracts, allowing the implementation contracts themselves to be taken over by an attacker on initialization.

## Tool used

Manual Review

## Recommendation
Invoke ``_disableInitializers`` in the constructors
